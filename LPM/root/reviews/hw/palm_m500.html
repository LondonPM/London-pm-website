Because of a fault with my Palm Vx, I recently upgraded to a m500. 
The fault was probably corrupted serial software which no doubt would 
have been fixed by a hard reset, but that would lose all my data, and 
due to the nature of the problem, I couldn't rely on my backups. Yes, 
my data is worth more than my hardware. A lot more. 
</p><p>
I bought the m500 because it has approximately the same dimensions as 
my old Vx, and almost all the same features. It isn't exactly the same 
size, weight and shape, but when holding it in my hand I can't really 
tell the difference. This is a Good Thing. I would have preferred the 
m505 because the colour screen has higher contrast, but couldn't 
negotiate a good enough price. 
</p><p>
The hardware has, obviously, changed somewhat. I don't know whether the 
CPU has changed, but several operations feel slower. I suppose this 
could be an OS 'feature'. The screen is apparently new as well. In good 
light it is somewhat higher contrast, and in very bad light the backlight 
is improved. But in only mediocre light things are slightly worse than 
the Vx, and the backlight makes everything invisible! The polarisation 
of the screen has changed by about 40 degrees. I used to get excellent 
contrast in just about any conditions whilst wearing my shades, but no 
more. Syncing is much faster, thanks to USB, although for me this benefit 
is only marginal, as the vast majority of my syncing is Avantgo, and thus 
limited by the speed of the Inertnet. Moving on to the case design, it is 
pretty similar to the Vx. Having seperate buttons for up and down is 
better than the old rocker button, but the power button/LED feels cheaper 
and more plasticky. The Vx had a groove down each side for storing a stylus 
and for attaching a cover. They were the same size, allowing for easy 
left- or right-handed use. The m500 has them different sizes, thus penalising 
sinister customers. And on the subject of covers, the Vx had a hard protective 
case available. The m500 does not. I bought a protective leather case, but it 
is substantially inferior - it is much bulkier and can not be opened as quickly. 
</p><p>
New features are a result of having an updated OS - v 4.0 - which adds a 
flashing LED and vibrating alert for alarms, more networking facilities, 
improved informational screens in the launcher, and support for memory cards. 
Of these, the improved alarm features are wasted on me, as I rarely use the 
alarm; the networking is also pointless, as I already have Avantgo (the new 
"web clippinqs" seeming like a second-rate alternative), and I have no desire 
to run up an enormous mobile bill; the launcher improvements are great; and I 
don't have any memory cards - nor do I see myself buying any soon - so can't 
test that. There may be other additions I haven't found yet. So far, all my 
software seems to still work, including hacks and apps like Memo Plus which 
replace built-in apps but use the same database. So overall, the OS meets my 
requirements with minor improvements. 
</p><p>
'Graffiti', Palm's sort-of hand-writing recognition, seems to be significantly 
degraded. In particular it has difficulty distinguishing between i and l and 
between c and f. The single-tap shift is frequently interpreted as a space. Not 
impressive, but I'll persevere in case this is due to bad habits I got in to with 
my Vx, which had a rather worn Graffiti area from heavy use. 
</p><p>
Moving on to the apps, there are few major changes. Built-in apps seem to still 
do all they did before (note that I never use the mail app so can't comment on 
that). There is an extra app, the Notepad, which allows the user to scribble 
directly on the screen. This is an exceptionally pointless idea. Normal hand-writing 
is damned near impossible on the screen; and it does not seem possible to attach 
scribbles to Memopad textual notes - something which the payware app Memoplus does 
very well. So Palm get no points for this new app. The Expense app has disappeared, 
which is a Very Bad Thing indeed. I gather from various online sources (this is not 
mentioned in the manual, not even in the 'upgrading from an older Palm' section) 
that I am meant to use the DocumentsToGo application from the CD. But this is 
useless to me, as it requires me to have MS Excel installed on my Mac. And, being an 
add-on app, it takes precious RAM. Rather a lot of RAM too. So I use the shareware 
app Expenseplus, which, while still taking a honking great wad of RAM has a free 
trial which fits my current needs, and if I need the full version, it's cheaper 
than Excel. 
</p><p>
I was hoping that some shortcomings of the built-in software would be fixed. 
But no, there's still no way of linking to address book entries from the Diary 
or To-do list. And diary entries still can't span multiple days without setting 
up a repeating event. 
</p><p>
So overall - I'd say that you're marginally better off sticking with a Vx. 
If you can find a new, unused Vx, buy it. But failing that, the m500 is adequate.
