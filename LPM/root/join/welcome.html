	<h2>So.. you really want to do it!</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		Well if you've got this far then you will probably want to go the whole way and join us.
		As mentioned in other locations on this site there are three (main) ways that one can join
		(all of which are free, or nominal cost - e.g. your phone bill to get internet connection!).
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Join the Mailing list</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		You can join the mailing list by visiting:<br />
		<a href="/mailman/listinfo/london.pm">http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/london.pm</a>
		</p><p>
		If you missed something you can look at the archives at<br />
		<a href="/pipermail/london.pm/">http://london.pm.org/pipermail/london.pm</a>
		</p>
		<p>The main list can be very busy, so you have the option of
joining the 
		announcement-only mailing list, which is moderated and very low
volume, at <br /> 
		<a href="/mailman/listinfo/london.pm-announce">http://london.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/london.pm-announce</a></p>
		<p>There's also Leon Brocard's summary list, which, as the name
suggests, takes the best of the list each week and condenses it down to a
single email. You can join the summary mailing list over at<br /> 
		<a href="http://www.astray.com/mailman/listinfo/london-list-summary">http://www.astray.com/mailman/listinfo/london-list-summary</a>
		</p>

		<p>There are also historical archives of the list, from before
June 2001 at <br />
		<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/london-pm%40lists.dircon.co.uk/">http://www.mail-archive.com/london-pm%40lists.dircon.co.uk/</a></p>

	<h2>Join the IRC channel</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		irc.perl.org:6667 #London.pm - you'll need an irc
client, a piece of
		string and one of those washing up liquid bottles.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Come to a pissup - oops, umm, meeting...</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		We have two sorts of meetings, the social and the technical. Social
		are just that, lots of people getting together to discuss various
		things, some even perl related. We start about 6:30 once a month on a Thursday (check
		the meetings diary for actual times and dates) and drink until the pub
		shuts and then go for a meal, or some combination of that.
		The Technical meetings are organised at a 'proper' venue (usually
		someone with a big meeting room at their company) and people
		are invited to give talks on whatever they are working on. These
		technical meetings have attracted people from Scotland, Wales
		and the odd (as in one or two, not as in wierd odd) Australian and
American.

about the next one and if there's an emergency or technical meeting in
the meantime.</p>
