	<p>"How do you write a book about a language that does not exist?"</p>
	
	<p>The short answer is that you can't. Here we have 208 pages of evidence that
	Perl 6 isn't just vapourware. Sure, you can't run a Perl 6 program yet (unless
	Damian's upgraded his brain to a multi-user OS), but most of basic design is
	done, a lot of Parrot (the runtime engine) is already written, and it is these
	things that this book is about.</p>
	
	<p>The book is split into three parts. The first 3 chapters are fairly short,
	and give an introduction to the Perl 6 project - how it came about, what is
	the philosophy behind it, and how is it structured. The information in these
	chapters set the scene for what is to follow, but I suspect it is also of use
	to anyone outside the Perl community who is trying to work out what the
	secrets of Perl's success are, and how to emulate that success with their own
	collaborative projects.</p>
	
	<p>Chapter 4 is the first big chapter, and gives a thorough grounding in Perl
	6 syntax. The chapter is organised as an introduction to Perl 6 for the
	beginner - somewhere between the a pocket-sized "Perl 6 quick reference" and a
	"Learning Perl 6". The layout and text are clear, building up from scalars
	through arrays and hashes into some of the newer Perl 6 features, such as the
	extra context types, the generic smart match operator (<span class="code">~~</span>),
	junctions and currying. The authors are careful to show how Perl 6 will be
	similar to Perl 5 by choosing examples that are very similar to exiting
	introductions to Perl 5.  You have to look very carefully to spot the subtle
	differences in Perl 6 syntax - for example <span class="code">open</span> returns a file
	handle, no parentheses are needed round the conditions of <span class="code">if</span>
	<i>etc</i>, and that the sigils <span class="code">@</span> and <span class="code">%</span> are used on
	array and hash element lookups instead of Perl 5's use of <span class="code">$</span>.
	Unlike the <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">Apocalypses</a>
	(Larry's design documents) or <a
	href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis/">Exegeses</a> (Damian's explanations
	of how to use the new features) this book doesn't explain what's changed, and
	what's the same - that's not its intent. It presents Perl 6 as a coherent
	language with a stand alone description, a plan which works well.  It took me
	about half the chapter to realise that no mention is ever made of Perl 5 -
	with this book you can learn Perl 6 without any any prior knowledge of
	Perl. (Although admittedly you'll be somewhat frustrated if you actually want
	to put your knowledge to use writing Perl 6 programs). The chapter concludes
	with rules (Perl 6's superset of regular expressions) and the new subroutine
	parameter syntax, so is currently completely up-to-date.</p>
	
	<p>Chapters 5, 6 &amp; 7 form the third part of the book, and describe parrot,
	the virtual machine on which Perl 6 will run. Parrot development is well under
	way, so there's a lot more of it in existence, and hence a lot more nailed
	down firmly enough to be written about. Consequently the Parrot section is
	about twice the size of the Perl 6 section. Chapter 5 introduces the design of
	Parrot, giving an broad overview of how its internals have been designed to
	give the flexibility and speed demanded respectively by the Perl 6 language
	and Perl 6's users. It explains the reasoning behind the design, such as why
	Dan has chosen to ignore current trends towards stack based virtual machines,
	and instead build a register based virtual machine. A lot is explained,
	clearly and concisely, but one commonly asked question seems to go unanswered,
	notably why write a whole new virtual machine rather than targeting (say) the
	Java VM or .NET.</p>
	
	<p>At heart, Parrot is a register based virtual machine, running bytecode
	not dissimilar to the machine code of a register based hardware CPU. Hence
	at the lowest level, you can quite happily program Parrot in its own assembly
	language. Although most sane people will not do this, the ultimate output of
	all other languages running on Parrot will be Parrot bytecode, so it is
	helpful for the authors of such languages to know what the underlying system
	can do easily, and what is hard. Chapter 6 details this assembly language,
	providing a thorough tutorial in how to bend Parrot to your will. Although
	the low level nature of the assembly language is syntactically  quite different
	from the high level language Perl 6, it directly supports most of the
	fundamental datatypes that Perl uses, such as arrays, hashes and lexical
	variables. This chapter is quite a lot drier than the chapter on Perl 6, and
	also ends with a 22 page quick reference, which might have been better as an
	appendix.</p>
	
	<p>Parrot assembler has a big advantage over Perl 6, in that you can already
	download a working implementation of it, so if you wish you could start
	writing programs in it immediately. Masochists can even write sophisticated
	self-modifying code, as the Parrot assembler contains an <span class="code">eval</span> op,
	although I suspect that even language implementors won't use the assembly
	language directly, but instead target IMCC, the subject of chapter 7. This
	Intermediate Code Compiler provides a much nicer target for compilers. Parrot
	itself has a fixed number of registers (32 of each type) whereas IMCC provides
	the illusion of infinite registers, so targeting IMCC instead lets you skip
	writing (and debugging) register spilling code. Likewise IMCC provides
	nested scopes to save each language having to write its own. A 6 page quick
	reference concludes both the chapter, and the book. An index follows, but
	there is no summary or conclusion chapter - it is taken as given that both
	Perl 6 and Parrot works in progress "to be continued...". This shouldn't come
	as a surprise as the introduction states that the intent is to publish a new
	edition of this book yearly to track developments up to the release of 6.0.0</p>
	
	<p>The book is really two books in one - an overview of the Perl 6 language
	which will be useful to people interested in writing in high level languages,
	and a working introduction to Parrot, which will be useful to people
	interested in writing language interpreters. I'm not sure how many people fit
	into both groups, and hence whether most people will find little to interest
	them in some of the chapters.  Based on their expertise, I suspect that the
	first 4 chapters were written by Allison, chapters 5 and 6 by Dan, and chapter
	7 by Leopold. However, it's impossible to tell because the style is consistent
	throughout, with both the Perl 6 and Parrot examples full of Hitch-Hiker's
	Guide to the Galaxy references. (A nice contrast to the camel book, which
	favours Flintstones and Simpsons references) </p>
	
	<p>So, should you buy this book, particularly as you know that it will be
	updated within 12 months? If you've been following the twisty maze of Perl 6
	development from the start, and you've been watching how the development lists
	functions, then you could argue that this is "just" telling you things that
	you already know, or at least do once you've been reminded of them. Even if
	you haven't, you could still glean most this information from studying online
	announcements and mailing lists archives (although you should avoid doing this
	if you value your time and your sanity). A notable exception are the contents
	of Chapter 3, <cite>Design Philosophy</cite> - I don't think the principles
	behind the design of Perl 6 have been written down in a coherent clear way
	before.</p>
	
	<p>My impression is the book is aimed at people outside the project looking
	in, who want to know what's going on. The authors and their excellent job of
	accurately and readably summarising the important bits, and unlike the list
	archives they don't fill your brain with a lot of things that you don't need
	to know. Even if you're already following Perl 6 or Parrot this book will give
	you a good summary of what has been decided to date.  However, it will date
	quickly (some of the parrot section is already history), so this year's
	edition will only really leapfrog you up to July 2003 - from there on you'll
	have to bring yourself up to date with the online documentation. If you don't
	want to do this, you could wait until next year's edition - although you'll
	have to be ready to move immediately that comes out, else you'll be in exactly
	the same position behind the times in 2004.</p>
