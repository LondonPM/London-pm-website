Steve Grand is a digital god. 
</p><p>
I'm not just saying that as some sort of hero worship or as a glowing
reccomendation of this book (although you could probably accuse me of
both) but because he concieves and creates binary creatures and imbues
them with life.
</p><p>
Steve Grand begat the Norns - the impossibly cute, wide eyed inhabitants
of the game Creatures (and all its sequels). Norns were not just some
sophisticated Tamgotchi, nor were they a clever hack designed to appear
life like whilst a Wizard like figure behind the screen pull all the
strings - Norns were designed to be alive.
</p><p>
Despite (or, possibly, because of) having Igor Aleksander as a lecturer
at college I've remained skeptical about the possibility of artificial
life and machine intelligence (I shy away from saying the more normal,
and loaded, Artificial Intelligence) but find the Intelligent agents in
games to be a fascinating field and so I bought this book expecting it
to be a HOWTO guide for building seemingly intelligent characters mixed
in with some Neural Net theory.
</p><p>
However I was pleasantly surprised to find a wide ranging and incredibly
complete (especially considering that it's only 263 pages long including
diagrams) book which was vaguely reminiscent of classic Feynman (but
without the misogony).
</p><p>
This book debunks the last 50 years of AI research but is cautiously
optimistic for the next 50 years claiming, that we've been looking in
the wrong place, that AI Research has failed its own Turing Test, and
that the solutions to the problems lie within this book.
</p><p>
Like any good theorem it starts off with the basics, by defining the
axioms that the rest of the proof can be built upon. Only in this case
it's more like redefining the basics - there is no such thing, argues
Grand, as matter.
</p><p>
I blinked hard a couple of times too.
</p><p>
Essentially the argument goes like this - matter is no more than a
disturbance in the universe just like a wave is nothing more than a
disturbance in water. Sitting typing this on a laptop that I've just
found out wasn't worth one and a half grand because, essentially, it's
not there, is a little disconcerting but after a short think and a nice
hot cup of tea it becomes a more palatable idea - think of it like this
: the same difficulty one has with believing that a thing is just a
disturbance in the universe is the same difficulty someone watching an
incoming tidal wave has with believing that it's 'just' a disturbance in
the sea and not a coherent thing.
</p><p>
For more on this read "The Matter Myth" by Paul Davies and John Gribbin.
</p><p>
>From there Grand goes onto explain clumping - subatomic particles clump
together to form atoms, to form molecules to form chemicals. At this
point, I have to admit, I was wondering what, precisely this has to do
with games and intelligence. The answer is positive and negative 
feedback loops which drive evolution and give rise to emergent
behaviour.
</p><p>
What Grand shows is that some seemingly intelligent behaviour, such as
ants storing all their dead in a mass grave is little more than emergent
behaviour. Ditto their path finding ability. By attempting to reproduce
piece meal pure learning or intelligence or reasoning classical AI
research has missed the point - what is needed is a combination of
emergent behaviour, learning and emotions and then you get the
intelligence 'for free'.
</p><p>
It works in the same way as writing the dynamics in a game. Pacman
didn't implement a physics engine - there was a simple rule that said
"you can't move into the walls". However the same rule would come for
free if it had been done with a physics engine. It would have Just
Worked [tm].
</p><p>
Still with me? Good, we're only half way through. And I've missed out
lots. 
</p><p>
Armed with these concepts we plunge into "God's Lego Set" - kind of
design patterns for the universe - which examines the tools at our
disposal before swerving neatly into "The whole Iguana" were we start
plumbing everything so that in "Igor hand me that screwdriver" we can
start building our virtual creature. Which is named Ron - Grand
unconvincingly tries to claim that it's named Ron because that was the
name of King Arthur's spear and also because of the infamous (mostly due
to Fight Club) series of Readers' Digest articles about body parts such
as "I am Jane's spleen" and, more relevantly, "I am Ron's brain".
</p><p>
With the equivalent of some virtual neurons and a small hormone factory
Ron quickly starts to take shape - what I liked best is the fact that
everyt time Grand describes a problem (and he's not afraid to admit the
mistakes he made and the corners he had to cut) there's always an
elegant hack to get round it - as a programmer I found this as beautiful
and as fascinating as the finished product and it's almost certainly the
hallmarks of a well designed system.
</p><p>
With everything plugged in the rubber gloves are donned and the switch
thrown. Lightening cracks, thunder roles, cliches are perpetrated. Ron
LIVES! 
</p><p>
The emergent behaviour is fascinating - when placed with other Norns we
discover that Ron, being attractive in a Norn kind of way learns that
the first things that run towards him are females wanting to mate. Sadly
when a truck rushes towards him he hasn't yet learnt to fear it so he,
err, attempts to get jiggy with the Semi. This, explains Grand, is a
feature not a bug.
</p><p>
The last few chapters of the book deal with consequences of having
machine life by taking stories from the online Creatures community
(which is even larger than the Quake) and from the worldwide population
of Norns - rough guesses place the figure in the several millions, more
than the worldwide population of elephants - such as how it reacted to
the Creature Torture site and the impassioned pleas of an Australian
family who had one of their Norns give birth to a deaf and dumb baby
(Grand did the equivalent of gene surgery, fed her up and sent her back
and then recieved a Christmas card from the family saying that little
'Kelly' was doing fine) - and mixing them in with some philosophy. For
examples he asks why people think that robots will try and take over the
earth - there is no point for them, their pleasure will be in serving us
and so extermination of the human race would be counter productive.
</p><p>
To sum up, an excellent book. Whilst some scientific knowledge (or at
least scientific interest) is useful it isn't required. It leads us
through fairly complicated ideas without patronising or bamboozling and
Grand writes with warmth and humour (viz. the Chapter titles mentioned
above - my favourite being chapter 7 which uses the Red Dwarf quote
"They call me Legion; for I am many" and starts with a quote from Elbert
Hubbard's Philistine "Life is just one damn thing after another") but
with obvious intelligence and passion, hence the Feynman comparison.
Or closer to home - think our own Mr Conway (Damian not John 'Game of
Life' Conway, although he is mentioned lots) but smoking from a
biological crack pipe rather than than a Latin or Quantum one. 
</p><p>
If you're interested in AI, biology, philosophy or just looking for a
good book to read then this book is 8 pounds very well spent.
