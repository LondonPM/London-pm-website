I really wanted to like this book: I liked the title, and I liked the
description of how to use Perl to program in lisp rather than using Perl to
program in C.  And Perl can do higher order programming: it has anonymous
functions as first class objects, which give closures, and can be used to
delay evaluation to allow lazy programming; there are even tricks with Perl
syntax to make it look more like higher order programming.  But Perl can't
do pattern matching on constructed values (like ML or Haskell) and as a
consequence there is only so far the syntactical tricks can go to make
higher order programming comfortable in Perl.  So, I'm afraid some 
parts of the book left me cold.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 1 explains recursion, what problems it is good for, and how it is
implemented in Perl.  The examples tackled typical recursive problems: the
Tower of Hanoi, and reading and writing tree structures such as directory
trees and HTML documents.  Recursion can also go wrong because naive
implementation lead to multiple calls to a function with the same argument
- Perl can not know this will always have the same result.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 2 explains the use of dispatch tables: these are hashes whose
values are (anonymous) subroutines.  This gives a more robust and flexible
way of detailing how to process nested structures such as configuration
files or expressions in a calculator.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 3 showed how to solve the problem with recursion in Chapter 1 using
memoization.  This detects multiple calls to a function with the same
argument and returns the previously calculated result from a cache; this
allows a naive implementation of calculating Fibonacci numbers to run
sensibly.  There are many subtleties to implementing memoization, which are
explained here, but the programmer using techniques can simple use the
Memoize module.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 4 described iterators and transformations on iterators.  Iterators
correspond to processes that produce a sequence of values, and they can be
transformed in the same way as stepping through a list - as long as the
transformation does not need to read to the end of the list.  Chapter 5
shows how to turn solve recursion problems with iterators and give other
general techniques for eliminating recursion.  I found these examples here
confusing: the elimination of recursion for the powerset function produced
reasonable code.  But the Fibonacci number example ended up with code that
was emulating the use of the stack in implementing recursion, producing
code that did not look like a reasonable, recursion-free calculation of
Fibonacci numbers<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  
</p>
<p>
Chapter 6 showed how Perl can model the infinite lists of lazy (functional)
languages, as streams.    The examples create streams of strings that match
particular patterns, e.g. regular expressions and grammars.  The streams
examples are also used for managing iterative numerical calculations.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 7 defines some higher order functions that are used in Chapter 8 to
define lexers and parsers based on streams.  A number of different parsers
are developed and form part of the extended examples in Chapter 9.
</p>
<p>
The book is clearly written and the code examples are clear but sometimes
the motivation for transforming/evolving the examples is not clear.  The
reader will learn much about higher-order programming and many new
techniques for designing their Perl code.  However they may find that
mimicking higher-order programming too closely in Perl may not be as
readable as true functional programs or other Perl programs.

<p><a name="footnote1">1:</a> For example:
<pre> 
    sub fib {
        my $n = shift; 
        return $n if $n &lt;= 1; 
        my($a, $b) = (0, 1); 
        while( --$n ) { ($a, $b) = ($b, $a + $b); }
        return $b 
    } 
</pre>
