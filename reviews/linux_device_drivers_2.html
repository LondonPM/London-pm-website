<p>The second edition gives you 592 pages total, across 16 chapters, written by 2
authors covering Linux versions 2.4.x, 2.2.x and 2.0.x. This contrasts with a   
first edition of 450 pages, <strong>17</strong> chapters, 1 author, covering 2.0.x and        
1.2.13. However, those statistics hide the enormous benefits to the rest of     
the book that the removal of that extra chapter brings. Chapter 17 in the       
first edition is entitled "Recent Developments" and gives 20 pages describing   
the major changes to Linux in the 2.1 development series up to 2.1.43. The      
first edition had the misfortune to overlap the 2.1 development series, so      
that by the time it was published in February 1998 it was already partially     
obsolete, as the 2.1 kernel had reached 2.1.84, and within a year it was out    
of date when the 2.2.0 kernel was released in January 1999.  In contrast, the   
second edition was published in June 2001, only a few months into the stable    
2.4 series, and 2.5.0 was not released until November 2001. Thus over a year    
later the book is still covering the current stable series, and looks safe for  
some time to come.  The book is also available online under the GNU free        
documentation licence at <a href="http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/">http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/</a>. I've not      
checked whether the online version has had updates since the hardcopy edition   
was committed to press.
</p>

<p>Although the second edition deals with three distinct versions of the Linux     
kernel, it manages to almost completely eliminate any complexity that           
describing multiple versions could have brought. The second edition is much     
better than the first edition, which could give a feeling of disorientation as  
it jumped back and forth between the two kernel versions it covered. The        
second edition achieves its serenity by structuring all chapters so that the    
main body only deals with 2.4.x series kernels. Example code is presented       
which will compile on 2.4.x, rather than code cluttered with <span class="code">#ifdef</span>s, and a  
note made of changes needed to give backwards compatibility to 2.2 and 2.0      
series kernels.  The detail of these changes is saved up to a Backwards         
Compatibility section at the end of each chapter, which keeps the main text     
flowing along nicely.  Concepts or functionality only present in 2.4 (or 2.4    
and 2.2) series kernels is clearly marked, as are kernel subsystems now         
principally maintained for backwards compatibility. This makes it easy to       
decide what features to use if you are only interested in writing drivers for   
2.4 (or later) kernels, and what features to avoid if you want to run on        
earlier kernels. It also gives the reader a clear idea of how the kernel        
systems have evolved over time, something that would not be easy to infer with  
just the kernel sources.</p>

<p>The book is carefully structured to build up logically, starting with simpler   
concepts in the early chapters, and building up logically so that more          
complex subjects in the later chapters don't require the introduction of        
many new ideas simultaneously. Hence chapter 2 describes how to build modules   
load the into a running kernel, configure them, and safely unloaded them when   
done. This description is all safely concluded before the first mention of      
how to write device drivers, which begins in chapter 3. The preface says that   
the book is structured in two parts - part 1 (chapters 1 to 10) give            
everything you need to know about writing a character device, and move from     
software towards hardware, whereas part 2 (chapters 11 to 16) cover more        
advanced topics such as block devices and network devices. The ordering is      
identical to the first edition, and was dictated because prior to the 2.4       
kernels block devices were implemented using many of the structures of char     
devices. The preface states that all the chapters cover a distinct problem,     
and generally they do, in a neat self contained fashion. One exception would    
be that the many small subsections on various features of char drivers          
collected in Chapters 3 and 5 ("Char Drivers" and "Enhanced Char Driver         
Operations") have to be ordered somewhat arbitrarily, but I cannot see a        
better way of smoothing the flow between the disjoint subtopics. Chapter 12     
("Loading Block Drivers") covers pretty much everything you ever wanted to      
know about block drivers (except mmap), request queues, partitioning, and       
then some. At 49 dense pages I feel that it could have benefited from           
breaking into 2 chapters (basic block devices, and "everything else")           
possibly with the mmap chapter put between as light relief. But apart from      
avoiding getting stuck in that tar pit the book is generally quite readable     
from start to finish without either your head exploding or drifting off to      
sleep. (And I confess that is what I have done, over the course of several      
weeks, without actually trying to program anything it has taught me). </p>

<p>All the example code in the book is supplied online at                          
<a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/linuxdrive2/">http://examples.oreilly.com/linuxdrive2/</a>. The book doesn't use code as       
padding - quite often code not necessary to illustrate the point is omitted     
from the printout in the book, with the reader referred to the downloadable     
archive. Likewise this is no "all the worlds a VAXC^Wx86". For the first      
edition all the code was tested on x86, alpha and sparc to ensure it was        
both 64 bit clean and endian neutral. For this edition the test battery is      
upped to x86, alpha, ARM, IA-64, M68K, PPC, Sparc, Sparc64 and VR41xx (MIPS)    
[Which is more than we're smoking perl on, as we have no M68K or IA-64          
test systems.] In addition the code is SMP safe, and the book is explicit       
in how to avoid SMP pitfalls.</p>

<p>If I have a gripe about the book, it is the diagrams. There are beautifully
drawn greyscale diagrams, credited to Robert Romano and Jessamyn Read, which    
look far more slick than say the austere simplicity of the black and white      
line drawings in the books of W. Richard Stevens. However, there are far fewer  
diagrams than in Stevens, and this text hardly refers to the diagrams.  For     
example, <a href="http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/figs/ldr2_0302.gif">figure 3.2</a>   
is captioned <em>the arguments to read</em>. The only mention in the text is the      
sentence "Figure 3.2 represents how a typical <em>read</em> implementation uses its   
arguments." No text talks through what the reader is supposed to learn from     
the diagram - in this case I believe it is illustrating how you need to be      
careful as a driver writer because some of the pointers you will be given will  
be to user space, others to kernel space, and that even though you need to      
treat them differently, there is no way for you (or the compiler) to infer      
which is which from their C types.                                              
<a href="http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/figs/ldr2_0501.gif">Figure 5.2</a> is a       
complex diagram illustrating "the data structures of poll", with a 1 sentence   
reference from the body text. There is no caption explaining the significance   
of the contents, nor is their body text. In a Stevens book this figure would    
be split into 3 or even 4 parts, each a diagram in itself.  Colouring or        
shading would be avoided unless it had a clear and explicitly stated            
contribution to the understanding of the concepts illustrated, and their would  
be one or more paragraphs explaining the important things to take in and        
remember from the diagrams.</p>

<p>At first I thought that this lack of integration of the diagrams was a side     
effect of the book also being available online. I was guessing that the         
illustrations were copyright O'Reilly and not online, and that there was a      
single text had to work with and without the diagrams. But this is not the      
case  - the online version has the same diagrams as the printed version, so     
there is no excuse for this lack of integration.  I feel that it means that     
the effort put into the diagrams is mostly wasted, as they add nothing to the   
text.</p>

<p>So does the book do the job? Yes, I think it does (but beware the caveat that   
I've not actually tried to write a device driver). The book seems to teach you  
things pertinent to the task of a device driver author that you couldn't pick   
up from a simple <span class="code">grep</span> of the kernel sources, such as the hows and whys of    
interrupts, scheduling your tasks for later, allocating memory suitable for     
DMA, the kernel interfaces for working with various kinds of hardware           
buses. There are also introductions to related topics, but this book correctly  
does not get sidetracked into the details, which would be enough to fill a      
book in their own right. The isn't a general introduction to the Linux kernel   
(for example it does not mention filesystems anywhere), but it does not set     
out to be one. Likewise it avoids the specifics of hardware almost totally,     
basing most of its examples on either devices that implement ramdisks or        
devices that implement loopback network drivers. The book attempts to teach     
the reader best practice in writing drivers, emphasising robustness,            
portability and maintainability. It is also clear to teach how drivers fit      
into Linux, keeping the distinction between mechanism and policy clear, and     
emphasising the Unix philosophy that policy belongs in userspace.</p>

<p>In summary this is a good book for a specific audience - people who need to     
write device drivers for Linux. Not a kernel primer. Not a hardware primer.     
Covers stuff you need to know. Not stuff you don't.</p>
