<p>This is a long review. I could have said "the book is missing things that I
think should be there" and leave it at that. But it's trivial to say, easy to
dismiss, and impossible to follow. As I'm clear in my head about the specifics
of what I think is missing but relevant to the book's subject matter, I've
backed things up every time with examples. This makes a much longer review,
but hopefully much clearer to follow, and easier to understand why I hold
my opinions. Maybe it's more of a short article than a review, but it says what
I feel I need to say.</p>

<p>The two authors have an excellent pedigree in the Perl world, and the
writing of this book generated direct improvements in the Perl code. Tim
Jenness is a respected module author, and submitted two thorough API testing
modules to the Perl core during the creation of this book. Simon Cozens
concentrated on improving the Unicode support in perl5.8, and was submitting
more core patches than I was prior to becoming the first parrot
pumpking. Despite herding the first 4 parrot releases and writing this book,
he still managed to contribute back significant core API documentation
updates.</p>

<p>Extending and Embedding Perl says that it assumes that the reader is a
competent Perl programmer, but it doesn't assume proficiency in C. <i>It
should be possible to gain a lot of benefit from this book without any prior
exposure to C</i> and to help achieve this the first and third chapters are
entitled "C for Perl programmers", and "Advanced C" respectively. I will
divide the book, and hence review, into two parts; the C tutorial, and the
rest of the book. I will start with, and concentrate on the important part -
the main book.</p>

<p>The "main book" consists 9 chapters of varying length; two are over 60
pages, two are under 15. Two deal with XS, Perl's extension language used to
automate writing glue code, with a third covering alternatives to XS. Two
provide references to how Perl holds variables, and the Perl API. The two
shortest chapters of the book describe embedding Perl into other
programs. Chapter 10 is called "An introduction to the Perl internals", and
covers how the Perl interpreter parses Perl source code to generates opcodes.
The final chapter describes the core Perl development process, and touches on
the future.</p>

<p>The authors say <i>we have worked hard to make this book the definitive
tutorial for all reference to all topics involved in the interaction of Perl
and C</i>. I find that the book sits uneasily between either - I don't find it
a clear introduction or tutorial to the internals of Perl, nor do I feel that
it will become my first port of call as a reference work. There are some parts
of the book I really like - the sections on interface design in the two XS
chapters gives an excellent guide on how to craft a natural Perl level
interface onto a C API. 20 pages are well spent in a clear description of the
multiplicity of ways to pass arrays to and from Perl, contrasting
implementation simplicity, Perl interface simplicity and speed. There are
insights into the internals, with hacks that I was unaware of, such as how and
why there is no simple <span class="code">IV</span> or <span class="code">NV</span> type, just
composites with <span class="code">PV</span>. The section on the <span class="code">B</span> modules is
an excellent guide to one of the most feared family of core modules (judging
by the fact that no-one has the courage yet to write regression tests for
them), clearly showing their underlying simplicity, and leaving me wondering
what everyone was so afraid of. There are good explanations of some of the
traps in C laying in wait for the unsuspecting Perl programmer, such as
<span class="code">float var = 1/4</span> being <span class="code">0.0</span> and the dangling
<span class="code">else</span> ambiguity. But ultimately I find the book disappointing,
which is sad, because I appreciate that a lot of effort went into its
production. I will group my concerns under 4 headings: ordering, overview,
insight and errors/omissions.</p>

<h2>Ordering</h2>

<p>The introduction recommends <i>that the experienced C programmer skip
chapters 1 and 3</i> (the C tutorial which I cover later). Chapter 4 says
<i>If this is your first look at the insides of Perl, feel free to skip this
chapter and come back to it later.</i> Chapter 5 says <i>This chapter is a
reference to the Perl 5 API ... you are encouraged to jump around this
chapter.</i> Chapter 10, the book's penultimate chapter is "An introduction to
the Perl internals". Some of the XS examples chosen for chapter 6 are actually
much simpler than many in chapter 2, and better illustrated how XS is meant to
work to simplify the programmer's task.  Smoothly breaking the reader into a
subject as self-referential as the Perl internals is hard, it means trying to
find a good order to minimise forwards references, but this is what a tutorial
should set out to do, and this book fails to find a successful order.</p>

<p>Ordering within chapters is also confusing. Chapter 5 sets out to be a
reference to the API rather than a tutorial, yet it is not in alphabetical
order. If anything, the API functions are set out in progressive order of
complexity, minimising forward references, more akin to a tutorial. Section
5.4.1 even starts <i>As usual, we'll begin our investigation</i> . Chapter 6
innocently presents an XS example, then adds after half a page of explanation
<i>As it stands, this code will not compile, because...</i>. Later during an
explanation of passing arrays it only announces after the code example that
actually this one differs from the previous implementation because it passes
by reference rather than in <span class="code">@_</span>. Chapter 4 first introduces the
general concepts of SV types and reference counting in dry text, before a very
accessible illustration of the same thing with simple Perl and
<span class="code">Devel::Peek</span>. I would have found it clearer the other way round; I
suspect that many Perl programmers would have too.</p>

<p>Some choices of introduction points for ideas are also illogical. Chapter 8
ends with a section "embedding wisdom" in which there is the point <i>Avoid
using Perl API macros as arguments to other Perl API macros (this advice is
also relevant to XS programming)</i>. Why is this advice first mentioned on
page 266 of 361, but neither in the chapters on the Perl API, nor in the
chapters on XS? Similarly, the only mention I can spot of the XS
<span class="code">BOOT</span> directive is in chapter 5, the Perl API reference.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The book only concerns itself with the details of the various topics it
covers. Nowhere is there any overview of the architecture of the Perl
interpreter; contrast this with the "Perl Internals" chapter of <i>Advanced
Perl Programming</i>[<a href="#1">1</a>] which starts with a description of
the architecture, accompanied by a block diagram of a running Perl interpreter.
As you read through it becomes apparent that Perl passes arguments to and
returns results from extensions via an argument stack, but this is not
stated up front. In fact, all argument passing in Perl between ops is done
via this stack, but the first mention of it is at page 169.</p>

<p>Likewise there is no overview of the XS language. XS is designed to provide
an quick[<a href="#2">2</a>] way to wrap external C libraries to create Perl
libraries. The XS compiler <span class="code">xsubpp</span> assembles complete C wrapper
subroutines from the XS instructions you give it. It has a template which it
uses to build the C wrapper, and various XS keywords are used to instruct it
on which pre-fabricated units to choose, or provide a custom over-ride for one
of its sections. As a C programmer I find it much easier to understand if I
think of it in terms of a tool that automates writing C for me, as C is
something I already understand, even if I don't yet understand the details of
the C that it is writing. But there's no paragraph like this to introduce XS.
And there's no table showing how the various XS keywords fit together in the
template to build a whole wrapper, or which keywords act as alternatives to
each other or to automatic code. In fact, the XS keywords aren't even listed
in one place, but introduced without fanfare throughout the book. Nor are the
various C variables that the XS code defines for you ever written out. As an
XS programmer you need to know their names to avoid choosing the same names
for your parameters or temporary variables. But they are never listed, only
alluded to.</p>

<p>Finally, Perl plays a lot of pre-processor games to hide its namespace from
other C programs, using C macros to redefine all its function names with a
<span class="code">Perl_</span> prefix, to avoid name clashes when linking with external
libraries. This lets your source code continue to refer to
<span class="code">sv_gets</span>, even though the symbol that the C compiler and linker see
is <span class="code">Perl_sv_gets</span>. The same mechanism is used to add in an extra
context parameter to pass thread local state around if you build a threaded
Perl. Being aware that all this is going behind the scenes is useful,
even though it's not something you normally need to worry about. But it is
possible for an XS author to make assumptions and mess up because of it, so
it is useful to be aware of it if things are going wrong for you. But the
book gives no overview of any of this, only a few passing references.</p>

<h2>Insight</h2>

<p>With two very experienced Perl developers as authors, I hoped that the book
would be full of insights into how things work, and tips and tricks of the
trade of the extension writer - things you can't learn from reading the
documentation or the source code. Some sections do give these, but there are
many places where there are things that I believe would have been beneficial
to state. The most important of these is <span class="code">PL_na</span>, an integer
variable originally provided to simplify user code that wants to ignore the
length returned by <span class="code">SvPV()</span>.  Because some code actually uses the
global <span class="code">PL_na</span>, to keep this code working <span class="code">PL_na</span> is
stored in thread local storage in a threaded Perl. Hence it represents a speed
hit, and new code should use a local variable instead. But the book doesn't
say this. Similarly, there's a C trap that it's easy to fall into when calling
a function <span class="code">foo</span>. This is tempting to write, but <b>wrong:</b>
<pre>
  STRLEN len; foo
  (SvPV(sv, len), len);
</pre>
because it's undefined behaviour in C (the code shown relies on the order of
evaluation of function parameters). The <b>correct way</b> is:
<pre>
  STRLEN len;
  char *pv = SvPV(sv, len);
  foo (pv, len);

</pre>
It's a trap that is easy to unwittingly fall into, so the book could have
mentioned it.</p>

<p>In the chapter on the Perl internals, section 10.3.2 describes sublexing,
and how the function <span class="code">scan_str</span> is called to extract a string
within balanced delimiters, which is then passed on to another function which
deals with variable interpolation. This description of how the quote and
quotelike operators are parsed is accurate, but it missed an opportunity to
give insight into the implications of this implementation. Because the end of
the entire string or regexp has to be found before it is digested, if you
patched the <span class="code">re</span> pragma to give an option to make extended regexps
the default, you still couldn't put <span class="code">/</span> inside a regexp comment,
because the Perl parser will stop at the first un-backslashed <span class="code">/</span>
that it sees, independent of internal regexp context. (Note that such a
pragma would get round the other problem: that the <span class="code">//x</span> flag is
after the regexp)</p>

<p>Chapter 7 describes SWIG, an alternative to XS which also generates wrappers
for Python, Ruby and many other languages. However, there's no discussion of
the strengths and weakness of SWIG, or when you should choose it over XS.
Until recently SWIG wasn't able to use nested Perl namespaces, hence all the
wrappers it generated had to be top level namespaces. Acceptable locally,
but no good for distributions. This limitation is now gone, but readers may
be aware of it, so the book should have mentioned it. SWIG has better
support for C++ in general, and automatically generating accessor methods for
C structures. However, it is limited to generating wrapper code that treats
each parameter in isolation, whereas XS gives you full power to override
its auto-generated code, letting you create wrappers with variable argument
lists, or the flexibility to cope with arguments being of different types
(scalars, array references etc). Simplifying: SWIG handles data better,
XS handles functions better. But Extending and Embedding Perl doesn't tell you
this.</p>

<p>The book starts to hint at the biggest design problem I found with SWIG. To
use SWIG you write an interface file, which SWIG converts to a wrapper. This
leads to two real difficulties. Firstly, you can't directly include system
headers defining types you need, because if you do SWIG will attempt to wrap
every function and structure it finds in them. So you end up duplicating the
definitions you need. Secondly SWIG generates your C wrapper code <b>and your
Perl module</b> from this interface file up front. There is a great temptation
to edit the auto-generated C and <span class="code">.pm</span> files, but you must
not. This is not what you might be used to with <span class="code">h2xs</span> and the
<span class="code">.pm</span> file it generates for you once. Couple this with the poorer
handling of arguments, and the result is that with SWIG is that you tend to
end up with one auto-generated <span class="code">.pm</span> file that gives the raw
interface, and another handwritten <span class="code">.pm</span> module that fixes up the
interface to give a more natural feel. This may not be what you want, either
for speed or aesthetics.  These two paragraphs may seem irrelevant - what am I
doing, going on about something that's not in the book? Well, that's my point
- I would have hoped that the book would give you an insight into all these
things, so that you learn from the experience others, rather than having to
spend the time on getting the experience yourself.</p>

<h2>Errors/Omissions</h2>
<p>Perl tracks which memory is in use by reference counting is structures
such as scalars. As a programmer manipulating the internals, you need to get
your reference counting right, otherwise Perl will leak memory or free things
prematurely. It's crucial to get this right, yet the book hardly touches on
it. There should be a whole section on how to do it - who owns the reference
of items on the argument stack, which API routines increase the reference
count for you on the assumption that this will save you another call, which
API routines hook the pointer you gave them into another structure without
changing the reference count, and in effect take a reference from you.
The book briefly mentions this, but with no more detail than I have here.
Most of the descriptions in the API reference section make no mention of
what they do to reference counts. When XS is introduced there's no mention 
that everything on the argument stack should be "mortal", as your caller
mortal copies things onto it, and copies off anything you pass back. This
alluded to later, but blink and you'll miss it. This is crucial stuff to
get right, but it's just not there.</p>

<p>Internally Perl throws and catches the exception generated by
<span class="code">die</span> by using C's <span class="code">setjmp</span> and <span class="code">longjump</span>
functions. The implication of this is that if something you call in the
Perl API causes a C level <span class="code">croak()</span> or a Perl level
<span class="code">die</span> (such as the <span class="code">FETCH</span> method on a tied value
that you read) then <span class="code">longjump</span> is going to bypass the rest of
your extension's code, and any cleanup and resource deallocation it would
have done. Hence if your extension is called in an <span class="code">eval</span>
Perl code execution will continue, but you will have leaked resources.
If you're trying to write bullet-proof code for a persistent environment such
as mod_perl this could become important. Yet Extending and Embedding Perl
never mentions this, or what can be done to ensure cleanup happens.</p>

<p>The Perl API reference in chapter 5 could never realisticly hope to cover
every nook of of the Perl API, as there isn't an official API - historically
people have just seen a function in the core source they liked the look of,
and started using it. However, the reference in chapter 5 is incomplete, in
that it doesn't cover all the Perl API used in the rest of the book. The body
text makes reference to <span class="code">sv_setref_pv</span> in two different chapters
without describing what it does. I didn't know, so I looked in chapter 5, but
it's not there. Similarly the API guide contains no entry for
<span class="code">SvUPGRADE</span> or <span class="code">sv_upgrade</span>. This considerably
diminishes the utility of the book as a reference - as I know that I may not
find something, I won't look in this book first. Likewise the scope macros
(<span class="code">ENTER</span>, <span class="code">SAVETMPS</span>, <span class="code">FREETMPS</span>,
<span class="code">LEAVE</span>) are mentioned several times but never clearly defined or
explained in the API reference. The API reference chapter's introduction
only ever uses the word "functions", never saying that many are actually
macros. The difference is crucial, as every competent C programmer knows to
avoid putting expressions with side effects, such as <span class="code">i++</span>, in the
arguments to a macro.  They are described as functions, so C programmers could
well treat them such, and this will cause bugs.</p>

<p>I spotted two subtle but potentially serious errors in the API reference.
Firstly, the <span class="code">SvIOK()</span> example is given as:<pre>
SvIVX(sv) = 123;
SvIOK_only(sv);

</pre>
You can get away with this on a fresh SV, but it could cause a core dump on a
re-used SV. The two statements <b>must</b> go the other way round, so that
<span class="code">SvIOK_only</span> can call cleanup functions for things such as the
offset hack. Secondly, the book wrongly says that <span class="code">hv_fetch</span> will
compute the key length for you if you pass in a length of zero. It does not,
and getting this wrong will cause hard to find bugs.</p>

<h2>The C tutorial</h2>
<p>The book starts with a chapter designed as an introduction to C for Perl
programmers, and the third chapter is described as "advanced C". People have
argued that a C introduction/refresher has no place in this book. I do not
agree - Perl is a weakly typed language with self-resizing strings builtin,
automatic memory management, introspection, and dynamic code compilation. C
is strongly typed, and has none of the other features. Yet Perl is implemented
in C, so somehow it has to be providing all its features using C. I think that
contrasting C and Perl, describing the similarities and emphasising the
differences, gives an excellent introduction to the Perl internals, setting the
scene for just how much they have to do.</p>

<p>However, the C tutorial given is not good. It is unclear, fails to define
important concepts, contains dangling cross references and several serious
errors. Worse still, it has a showstopper error. This <b>should</b> have been
spotted, and the production run stopped until it was corrected. Strings in
C are very different from Perl, and often a source of errors even among
experienced C programmers. Page 58 gives an example of how C strings work.
The entire explanation is based around manipulating a string as defined
below, with an accompanying box diagram as shown:

<blockquote><span class="code">char a[5] = "hello";</span> <table
border="1"><tr><td><span class="code">h</span></td><td><span class="code">e</span></td><td><span class="code">l</span></td><td><span class="code">l</span></td><td><span class="code">o</span></td><td><span class="code">\0</span></td></tr></table></blockquote>
This is a serious off by one error. The initialiser as given is valid C
(although not C++) but does not do what you want to do here. If you attempt to
compile the code with a C++ compiler, such as g++, you get this error message:
<pre>offbyone.c:1: initializer-string for array of chars is too long
</pre>

The actual data stored in the array <span class="code">a</span> in C is this:
<table border="1"><tr><td><span class="code">h</span></td><td><span class="code">e</span></td><td><span class="code">l</span></td><td><span class="code">l</span></td><td><span class="code">o</span></td></tr></table>

(note lack of terminator) which means that the rest of the section is
completely wrong. For an introduction this is appalling - anyone reading this
will think that the C language automatically adds an extra byte of storage for
the terminating <span class="code">\0</span>. It <b>never</b> does. <span class="code">strlen()</span>
never counts the <span class="code">\0</span>, but you must remember to add one for it if
allocating memory. This is probably the most common C bug, yet it's not
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="code">NULL</span> is introduced without definition or explanation.
<span class="code">NULL</span> pointers are an important concept in C - nowhere is it
mentioned what they are, or that in a numeric context they evaluate to 0, and
hence are logically false, whereas all other pointers are true. C has a
<span class="code">switch</span> statement - just about the only part of C syntax that is
not part of Perl's. But the book doesn't make it clear that this is only for
integers, and the case targets have to be integer constants. This would be an
obvious point to note, because in the chapter on XS the book there is a
section describing the C code for finding constants that Perl utilities
auto-generate - effectively the utilities are writing out a
<span class="code">switch</span> on strings longhand, because C's builtin
<span class="code">switch</span> cannot do this.</p>

<p>The contents of rest of the book are good; my principle complaints are the
ordering and the omission of related or relevant content. The C tutorial is
actively bad. Avoid.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In summary, excluding the C tutorial, the content of the book is good.
There are a couple of small factual errors, but these do not mar the book.
However, I feel that the book is a missed opportunity. The existing content is
not in an optimal order for a tutorial, the main API reference section is not
laid out in an easy order for direct lookup, and there are no reference tables
or diagrams for other information important to an extension writer. The
opportunity was there to provide much greater insight into how Perl works, and
how to write extensions, but it was rarely taken. This book makes me sad,
because it could have been so much more.
