	<h2>What is this section for ?</h2><div class="item">
		<p>Well, reviews! We get sent books, we buy books, we go to films; we exist in the world.
		Here are a few reviews of things we have experienced. Please note that these
		reviews are the personal feelings of the author and therefore no reflection
		on the opinions of the collective London.pm (collective London.pm, that's quite a worrying thought, almost borg-esque).
		</p>
		<p>If you've got a review you want to see here, first post it to
		the list- (Start the subject with REVIEW:) so people can discuss
		it- and also mention it to <a
		href="mailto:david@cantrell.org.uk">Dave</a>, so he can add it to the site.</p>
