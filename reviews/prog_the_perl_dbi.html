I have mixed feelings about this book.  To be honest, I haven't really
read it properly.  Let me explain why....
	</p>

	<p>
The book starts off with a section describing the concepts of databases
and then moves on to talking about other options other than DBI to the
programmer, such as flat files, storeable and Data::Dumper and even DBM
files. Unfortunately, as the stressed out programmer I have neither the
time or inclination to read this.  Nor do I care about the SQL tutorial.
I learned SQL back in uni, and what I really need is the one thing missing
from the chapter...a summary of the commands by name.
	</p>

	<p>
Moving on through the book by page 87 I get the first example of some
actual perl code that deals with the DBI.  My impatience (apparently a
virtue) has caused me to skip all the sections describing the model of how
the DBI abstractions work without any real example.  And now I don't
instantly understand them.  Maybe it's just me.
	</p>

	<p>
Nice section on handling errors...now this is something all database
people need to read, including the section on using eval and handling
errors.  Finally something useful advice that I can't get just by reading
the pod.  Section on quoting.  Nice.  If I just slow down a little and
start reading properly...
	</p>

	<p>
Now the really important bit of the book.  The bits I actually bothered to
make time to read, The bit I wish I could just rip out and stick in it's
own little book.  Chapter 5 and Chapter 6...The basic hows and whys of the
many fetch methods that DBI uses.  If you've ever used DBI then you'll
know there's about a zillion ways to pull out data...and this section
describes which one to use and why.  Oh and stuff on dealing with weird
data types.  And how to close handles prematurely.  In fact, pretty much
all of the important "Now how do I do *that* questions" - this stuff
really *isn't* in the pod.
</p>
<p>
Moving swiftly on we get onto some discussion about ODBC.  The section is
heavily prejudiced and tells you what (and really only just what) you need
to know to survive with ODBC if you've been using DBI.  If you like this
or not is really up to you...more skipping on my part.
</p>
<p>
The latter half of the book is a collection of appendices.  Included is the
DBI specification that tells you exactly how each command works which is
just a more readable version that the pod. YMMV...I tend like having both
thid dead tree summary and a pod guide open at the same time as they
complement each other well.
</p>
<p>
The last apendices is a collection of information on the different DBD
(data base drivers) that handle the connection to the databases and the
peculiarities that go with each of these.  Nice if you need it.  The MySQL
drivers are notable by their absence.
</p>
<p>
Okay, back to why I haven't read this book properly.  Don'y you see?
Half the book I didn't really need to read.  But it was hard to find the
bits that I did and would have been really entertaining and useful.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion I think that Programming The Perl DBI is a good book that
could have benefited tremendously from some judicious editing.  Lots of
content needs to be cut out and reworded to be more concise.  In
particular the book could do with a better structure (and more whitespace)
that makes things easier to find and 'flick to'.  Or maybe I'm just
looking for a different book.
