<strong>Summary:</strong> An excellent resource for the Linux administrator concerned with
security.</p>

<p>This book is a comprehensive guide to Linux security. While many books
deal with installation and setup of a basic server system, they tend to
be lacking in any security consideration, preferring to emphasise ease
of use; this is the requisite companion volume to those, assuming a
basic competence in Linux use and concentrating on security concerns.</p>

<p>

Throughout the book, the author emphasises that systems fail: the
existence of a firewall doesn't entirely prevent attacks on systems
within it, proxies can be subverted, and so on. This leads him to a
preferred position of robust defence in depth.</p>

<p>

Although the book is copyrighted 2003, its history is in a series of
columns written by the author for _Linux Journal_; in places it is
significantly outdated, for example considering Debian release 2.2 as
the most recent version even though 3.0 was released in July 2002.</p>

<p>

The book opens with a consideration of risk. Since there is no such
thing as a perfectly secure system, against whom should one attempt to
protect it, and with what level of resource will it be attacked?
Obviously there are no quick answers, but the author provides a set of
tools with which reasonable estimates can be made.</p>

<p>

The next chapter deals with perimeter networks: how to position
firewalls and routers to reach a useful compromise between accessibility
and security. Various types of firewall are considered, including
commercial hardware-based products; this book is a rare example of work
by an author whose expertise is primarily in open-source systems but who
is also familiar with current commercial software.</p>

<p>

The book now starts to go into rather more detail, as it describes the
process of hardening a Linux server; the basics of this are as they have
been described for a long time (run only necessary software, keep up to
date, read the security mailing list for your chosen distribution), but
the author expands usefully on all these concepts. This is one of the
more basic chapters, but even the experienced administrator can usefully
refresh and expand his knowledge. This chapter also covers security
scanning with nmap and Nessus, as well as the Bastille Linux automated
hardening system.</p>

<p>

Remote administration tools are the concern of the next chapter,
starting with ssh (the author rightly deprecates telnet and related
clear-text administration tools) in some details, then briefly coverying
sudo. Next is SSL tunnelling with stunnel, probably the most convenient
of the programs available, including its client-certificate
authentication mode (probably the trickiest part of stunnel to set up).</p>

<p>

The next four chapters deal with the security of specific applications,
starting with DNS. Remarkably, the author is prepared to mention the
existence of djbdns as well as bind, and gives it a substantial amount
of space; this is one of very few descriptions of djbdns in print, and
would deserve attention for that even if it were not rather more clearly
written than the official documentation. Next comes email, with a long
general section (mostly considering unauthorised relaying) and detail on
two specific mail transport agents, sendmail (because of its popularity)
and postfix (because of the author's admitted bias in its favour). It is
unfortunate that no room could be found for exim or qmail as well, as
this would have provided coverage of the vast majority of SMTP servers
deployed on Linux platforms.</p>

<p>

The web services chapter only covers Apache, which is perhaps a
pardonable failing given its preponderance on Internet-connected hosts,
though some coverage of the many lighter-weight servers would have been
welcome; it also covers CGI script and authentication security, though
not in any great depth (these are more properly the province of the
developer than of the system administrator in any case). The final
application chapter, on file services, describes ProFTPD in some detail
with some limited consideration of sftp and rsync.</p>

<p>

The book's final section returns to the business of system, rather than
application, administration, with consideration of intrusion detection.
One chapter covers inbuilt systems for this (syslog and its
ramifications including remote loggin, syslog-ng, and the automated
log-watcher swatch); the other deals with external monitoring packages
such as tripwire (and some of its kin) and snort. An appendix gives
pre-built iptables firewall scripts.</p>

<p>

The book is rather shorter than some other security handbooks on the
market, and more space could perhaps have been given to alternative
application software, particuarly for email and web services (and client
mail protocols such as POP3 and IMAP are not even considered). Moreover,
a slightly expanded treatment of networking - covering security under
N:N masquerading  rather than the simple N:1 described here and in a
hundred existing articles - would have added significantly to the value
of the book.</p>

<p>

The quality of the prose is good and clear throughout, and examples are
generous though not excessive. In summary, this is a book that I should
recommend to anyone running a Linux server in an environment where not
all potential users are fully trusted.
