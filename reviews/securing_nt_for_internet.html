I must admit that I was dubious about volunteering to cover this book when I saw it
on offered on the list, I was expecting to open it up and see in huge letters,
one to a page,
</p><p>
Step 1 "Unplug the Ethernet cable."<br/>
Step 2 "Remove the power lead."<br/>
Step 3 "Feel secure."<br/>
</p><p>
But I thought what the hell, I work in a Windows shop so I'll
read it during the work day and get the company to cover my time. 
That worked out a very good move to make.
While anyone that has spent any amount of time building NT and now
Win2K boxen will know that making them secure enough to stand up on an
Internet facing connection is no easy mark, the author of this book,
Stefan Norberg, has released the best and most comprehensive guide to
giving Windows admin's a fighting chance to date.
</p><p>
The book itself is slim and to the point, the author has a terse
writing style that lets him cover a lot of very technical material
quickly. From the start of chapter one and a quick high level intro to
network security models, Windows architecture and a brief detour into
both crypto and network protocols the tone of the book is shown to be
brief and very technical, experience with Windows and networks is
assumed in the reading audience. While this takes the book out of the
hands of beginners it means that the book can cover a hell of a lot of
ground in its 200 odd pages. I personally like this style and its one
of the biggest selling points of O'Reilly books for me, more info in
less pages.
</p><p>
The second chapter takes you through a tour of what is running after a
default install, what it does, what it leaves open to attack and most
importantly how to turn it off. This is one of few security books I've
seen that show you how to disable the built-in Windows networking
services that get left on after every install. The coverage is nigh on
complete and includes services, user accounts, the registry and even
optimising the resilience of the Windows TCP/IP stack. The only aspect
of this chapter I could find any issue with is that towards the end of
the chapter the explanations seem to get less terse and more rushed.
Not a major gripe but annoying considering how good the rest of the
chapter is.
</p><p>
Chapter 3 covers the differences between securing an NT and a Win2K
box and then covers the newer features such as the IPSec
implementation and how to set up filters on the host itself. This
chapter is quite short as it builds on the previous one and only
highlights the differences between the two.
</p><p>
The second half of the book covers the running, role and maintenance
of the secured hosts. Chapter four covers some of the options
available for secure remote admin of the boxen including PCAnywhere,
Terminal Services (slightly overkill in my view) and an Open Source
based solution involving SSH, Cygwin, TCP Wrappers and VNC. Which
together make a pretty potent combination of tools but one that
requires a fair amount of effort to deploy effectively.
</p><p>
The author then gives over a number of pages and an appendix (C)
detailing how to install and build these tools on Windows. This is the
weakest point of the second half of the book for me. I'd rather have
more coverage of tightening up policies than build instructions but
the author evidently knows his audience and when one of my co-workers
flicked through the book he was impressed by the comprehensive build
instructions. Proof that Linux and Windows admin's are from different
disciplines.
</p><p>
Chapters five, six and seven cover more of the day to day jobs that
need covering on a public facing server, how to plan and implement
secure backup policies and the issues these raise. How to correlate
auditing information and related topics such as network time syncing
(And why NNTP is better than SNTP, something I could have done with
about six months ago.) An overview of integrating Event Log with
Syslog (Although this section is a little light on details) and ending
with a very short chapter on the different types of audits that you
should consider for your shiny new fortress.
</p><p>
I would have liked the book to expand a little and cover the securing
of an IIS server under each of the operating system's as this is where
I see most people deploying a Windows bastion host. It would have
moved the book away from a pure OS level look at hardening but would
have made a worthwhile addition.
</p><p>
Summary: If you do Windows admin then read this book. You'll be safer
for it.
