Astronomy Hacks is yet another installment in the series from the good                             
people at O'Reilly. This is actually not the first book that O'Reilly                              
has done about something astronomy-related since they published a                                  
SETI-related tome in 2001 (Beyond Contact by Brian McConnell), however                             
it is still somewhat an anomaly.  Still, they did Mind Hacks, so why                               
not Astronomy Hacks?                                                                               
</p>

<p>                                                                                                   
Coming from O'Reilly, such a book would have a task of balancing its                               
audience and addressing the hard-core as well as the newbies. This book                            
was mostly geared towards beginner observers -- those who have gotten                              
their feet wet in the great Astronomy Sea, but who are hungry to                                   
waste...I mean, invest more time, money, and energy into the hobby.  It                            
includes sections on how to select binoculars, the pros and cons of                                
various types of telescopes, and how to select quality accessories.                                
There are also various hacks that go beyond the beginner level and                                 
cover more advanced topics like scope collimation, mirror cleaning,                                
running a Messier Marathon, and so on.

<p>                                                                                                   
Like the other 'Hacks' books in the O'Reilly series, Astronomy Hacks                               
consists of four major chapters subdivided into ten to twenty hacks per                            
chapter.  The four major chapters cover: Getting Started, Observing                                
Hacks, Scope Hacks, and Accessory Hacks.  And yes indeedy, there is an                             
index!                                                                                             
</p>

<p>                                                                                                   
Overall, Astronomy Hacks is pretty densely packed with common-sense                                
guidance for observers new and old. A lot of the hacks are simple and                              
clear and involve being resourceful, like all great hacks do.  The                                 
authors are obviously very hardcore amateur astronomers and they really                            
know their stuff.                                                                                  
</p>

<p>                                                                                                   
There are some great encouraging bits for beginners in the Getting                                 
Started section, starting with Hack #1: 'Don't Give Up!' I also                                    
appreciated that Hack #4 was 'Stay Warm', since under-dressing is                                  
something that beginners perpetually get wrong.  These little touches                              
that take the sting out of standing around in the dark and cold while                              
fiddling with bits of kit are both useful and heartening.  Also, Hack                              
#10: 'Equip yourself for Urban Observing' is solid advice for those of                             
us who live under the London light dome.                                                           
</p>

<p>                                                                                                   
The later hacks get more into the nitty gritty of things.  The                                     
Observing Hacks cover things from dark-adapting your eyes and using red                            
filtered lights, to making sketches of what one sees through the                                   
eyepiece. This section sort of goes without saying for the more                                    
experienced, but it does a good job of explaining things like                                      
magnitudes and surface brightness.  It also touches on the celestial                               
coordinate system, star hopping, and urban observing skills, which are                             
all fundamental.                                                                                   
</p>

<p>                                                                                                   
Scope and Accessory Hacks include upgrading the bearings on a Dobsonian                            
mount, picking a good arsenal of eyepieces, and dark adapting your                                 
laptop for field use.  These hacks are solid advice and even fairly                                
seasoned observers will pick up a very handy nugget or two of                                      
information.  The Scope Hacks section is overtly Newtonian-centric, so                             
it ends up being completely irrelevant to some people (like me).                                   
Otherwise, the Accessory Hacks section is probably by far the most                                 
insightful section for the more experienced observers. Hack #51 on how                             
to 'build' an occulting eyepiece is pretty ace.                                                    
</p>

<p>                                                                                                   
However, the overly didactic tone of voice can be very irritating at                               
times.  Like computer geeks, astronomy geeks can be a bunch of                                     
over-opinionated blowhards.  At times, this book is dripping with the                              
authors' opinions when they are supposed to be simply providing gentle                             
guidance and/or an overview for the reader.  Really, I appreciate the                              
chivalrous gesture of refusing to leave a group of silly helpless women                            
alone at night (god forbid!), but no thanks; and REALLY, I don't fancy                             
packing heat when going up to observe on Hampstead Heath like they                                 
suggest in Hack #3. The pronunciation key for various bodies is also                               
amusing, even if they admit that 'Vega is properly pronounced WAY-guh,                             
but if you say that way people think you're strange.'  Indeed.  So why                             
bring it up?                                                        
</p>

<p>
Even in the scope buying section (Hack #9), they again veer off into                               
crazy obnoxious opinion land when they unceasingly laud the glories of                             
Dobsonian telescopes while slagging off all other types of scope at                                
hand.  Different people have different reasons for choosing their                                  
particular type of telescope, just like programmers choose different                               
tools for their needs.  This doesn't necessarily mean that one tool or                             
telescope is any better than the others overall, merely that some are                              
better suited for certain purposes than others.  Dobsonians are                                    
great...I just can't lug one on the train so easily.

<p>                                                                                                   
This book is like lurking on a mailing list for fairly hardcore amateur                            
astronomers, absorbing the information for at least a year, and then                               
distilling it into a handy dandy book.  Astronomy Hacks is essentially                             
a FAQ-from-hell about observing and is really quite useful.</p>
