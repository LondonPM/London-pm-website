    <p class="intro">

      helping each other, 
      <a href="/join/">discussing</a> topics, sharing information and 
      the occasional drink and mention of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

    <p>
      We are part of the world-wide <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl
      Mongers</a> group and play host to (as well as visit) others from
      round the world.
