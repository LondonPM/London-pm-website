	<h2>What is Perl?</h2><div class="item">
		<p>From the <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/perl/view/pod/perl.pod#DESCRIPTION">Perl manpage</a>:
		<em>
	    Perl is a language optimized for scanning arbitrary text files,
	   	extracting information from those text files, and printing
	   	reports based on that information.  It's also a good language
	   	for many system management tasks.  The language is intended
	   	to be practical (easy to use, efficient, complete) rather
	   	than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).</em></p>
