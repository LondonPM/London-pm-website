	<h2>Our Camel</h2><div class="item">
		<p>We've sponsored a camel at London Zoo.</p>

		<p>Like many zoos, <a href="http://www.londonzoo.org">London Zoo</a> runs an animal adoption
     		scheme. Full details can be found <a href="http://www.londonzoo.org/adoptions/adopt.html">here</a>, 
		but basically
     		you send them some money which they use to care for a
     		particular animal and you get your name on a plaque
     		next to the animal's cage.</p>

		<p>I think that the idea was first mentioned in 1999
                at one of our pub meetings. It was obvious
                from the start which animal we wanted to adopt. There
                was a slight hiccup when we discovered that it costs
                1000 pounds to adopt a camel (llamas are far cheaper), but
                we decided that there was enough interest between us 
                raise the money. </p>
		<p>It's taken a bit longer than expected (partly due to 
		the two people who were collecting the money disappearing 
		off to Europe to live) but on August 6th 2000 - the 
		second anniversary of our first meeting, we finally 
		became proud adopted parents of our camel. The plaque 
		should be up by the end of August.</p>

		<p>In our adoption pack, we also got a load of free zoo
		tickets (so we can all go and see our camel) here is a picture
		of a camel (just in case we didn't know what one looks like)</p>

		</p>
		<p> We also have a <a href="/static/images/cert.gif">certificate</a> proving that
		we've done it.</p>

		<p>We all feel very proud of our good works and would
		like to encourage other Perl Monger groups to do the
		same with their local zoos. It's very likely that
		other zoos run similar schemes.</p>
