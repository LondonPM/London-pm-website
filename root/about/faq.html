        <p>Look for a cluster of noisy geeks. It's usually quite easy to
        spot us. The <a href="/meetings/">meetings page</a> may say something about where in the pub (as
        well as in which pub) we're likely to be found.</p>

    </h2><div class="item">
		<p><span class="person">Dave (Cross)</span> is the founder of London.pm and was considered 'our leader' until Dec 13th 2001; if there are any problems (or, occasionally, as an excuse) then the standard response is 'Dave told us to'. Due to his no longer being our leader we are not sure of the status of this statement.</p>

	<a name="recruiters-at-meetings" /><h2><a href="#recruiters-at-meetings" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">I'm a recruiter, is it ok to come to a meeting?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
	
<p>The simple answer is 'yes', however to try and make sure everyone is happy and remains that way we've put together a few guidelines/suggestions that we hope are useful.</p>

<ul>
     
<p>
Social meetings are open to anyone.
</p>

<p>
If people are using them for a commercial purpose, then it's
considered good form to throw something extra into the kitty.
After all free beer/soft drink always tastes better than normal beer/soft drink.
</p>

<p>
People conducting commercial activities should remember that
mongers are typically unwinding after a hard days work, so a
hard sell is not welcome.
</p>

<p>
It's considered bad manners to join a group who are chatting
and to ignore the current topic and simply steer the
conversation to your objective as fast as possible. Even if you
are coming to a meeting for a purely commercial reason please
attempt to get involved. Who knows you might even find it interesting.
</p>

<p>
General sentiments were summarised well on list by one member as "As long as those with commercial intent remember that we're a community,
not an audience all should be fine." 
</p>

</ul>
<p>
We look forward to seeing you - the best way of hearing about upcoming meetings is to join the announce list.

	<a name="archives" /><h2><a href="#archives" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Oooops, I missed a load of posts.  Are there any archives? <img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>Yes, on this very site there are <a href="/pipermail/london.pm/">mailing list archives</a>, from June 2001 onwards. There are fragments of older archives: details are in the <a href="/join/">'join us'</a> section.</p>

	<a name="irc" /><h2><a href="#irc" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What's the IRC thing?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>The IRC channel is #london.pm on irc.perl.org.</p>
		<p>You can talk to people about all sorts of things- as with the list, occasionally there are Perl questions, but a lot of it is banter. It's also a good place for your oneliners. There's more about it on the <a href="irc.html">IRC page.</a></p>
	</div>

        <!-- p>If you're worried your email is broken (or, indeed, that the email to the list is broken instead), dipsy on #london.pm has a script that looks for the latest mail to the list- ask it 'dipsy, mailcheck' and it should say what the most recent mail it's seen is.</p -->
        
        <a name="dipsy" /><h2><a href="#dipsy" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Who is Dipsy?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
                <p>Many years ago Kevin Lenzo wrote the veneral <a href="http://infobot.org">Infobot</a> and one 
                   such example, called <tt>purl</tt>, lives on <tt>#perl</tt>.</p> 
                <p><tt>#london.pm</tt> aquired their own infobot and 
                   called him/her/it <tt>dipsy</tt>. The bot quickly aquired its 
                   own set of modifications.</p>
                <p>Several years later, frustrated with the quality of the Infobot 
                   code some members of London.pm ported the extensions to be
                     <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bot-BasicBot-Pluggable/"><tt>Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable</tt></a> 
                     plugins with a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bot-Infobot"><tt>Bot-Infobot</tt></a> frontend.</p>
                <p>You can see what plugins are installed by asking <tt>dipsy</tt> for "help" in a privmsg.</p> 
		<p>People wanting to change the bot's functionality are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to write a new plugin or provide patches against <a href="https://jerakeen.org/svn/tomi/Projects/">svn</a>.</p>

    <a name="heretics" /><h2><a href="#heretics" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Who are these Heretic people?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>Initially London.pm had a very simple rule for meetings (at the time, there were only social meetings), namely that they were on the first Thursday of the month.</p>

		<p>As you'd expect, though, sometimes that meant that the meeting was on the first day of the month. However, <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/london-pm%40lists.dircon.co.uk/msg02547.html">one prominent member</a> once missed this meeting, and turned up on the following Thursday -- the 8th -- and posted to the list the following day wondering where everybody was.</p>

		<p>As a result there grew a heretical sect around this member who maintained that meetings were held on the first Thursday of the month, unless that was the first day of the month; this was later shortened to 'meetings are on the day after the first Wednesday of the month'.</p>

		<p>This was how things stayed for a while, and in 2001 there were two meetings in February and March on both Thursday 1st and Thursday 8th. Plans were brewing, though, and in August, at YAPC::Europe, the date of London.pm meetings was put up for auction, and <a href="http://use.perl.org/use.perl.org/_davorg/journal/1191.html">Dave Cross</a> [his explanation of the term] lost.</p>

		<p>Hence, official meetings now follow the 'day after the first Wednesday' rule and the 'new heretics' recognise the original formula, meeting whenever a Thursday that is the first day of the month happens.</p>

	<a name="camel" /><h2><a href="#camel" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">You've got a camel?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		   Not any more, but we did sponsor a camel at London Zoo for nearly two years (late 2000 to 2002). 
                   Some of the people who put money towards it (and some others who didn't, but we don't mind) 
		   went to see it in August 2001. Paul has photos on <a href="http://husk.org/perl/zoo/">his site</a>, if you're interested.
		</p>

	        <p>We also have a <a href="camel.html">page about the camel</a>.</p>

	<a name="muffins" /><h2><a href="#muffins" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Why has someone just criticised muffins at conferences or muffins in general?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>Well, when we were planning YAPC::Europe 2000 one of the things that came from the North American YAPC was the obsession of American conference attendees. Or at least a playful charicature of American conference attendees,  in that they seemed to be obsessed with muffins, and one of the hardest things we had to deal with at YAPC::Europe 2000 was catering. Not providing muffins (it was after all 40 quid for 3 days) almost became our little rebellion against the expectations of conference goers. In the end we provided one of the best buffet lunches that will ever be had at a Perl conference including free wine, which I believe set some attendees up for a very drunken afternoon. But we didn't provide muffins.</p>
	</div>

	<a name="topic" /><h2><a href="#topic" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Why do some posts about Perl get prefixed '[OT]'?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>There are so many off-topic posts on london.pm that some people find it amusing to mark posts that are about Perl with [OT]. Whether in this case they mean on the list's topic or off the list's offtopicness is a matter of debate.</p>
	</div>
	
	<a name="spoiler" /><h2><a href="#spoiler" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What is a spoiler?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>A spoiler is giving away an important or unexpected plot element in a film or TV series that someone hasn't seen yet.</p>

<p>
People generally don't like knowing too much of what's going to happen in advance, so we have a spoiler policy on the mailing list that you don't reveal important plot details of a TV series until it's aired on UK terrestrial television, and similarly that you don't reveal plot elements from a film until a month or so after release (although some warning is still appreciated then.)
</p>

<p>
People in the US or who have non-terrestrial (eg Sky) television, in particular, need to be careful when discussing such TV series.

<a name="buffy" /><h2><a href="#buffy" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What is Buffy?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">

<p><a href="http://www.buffy.com/">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> (official site, US based) is a television series that a lot of people on London.pm enjoy, partly because it is a sharp, witty, well-written synthesis of teen drama with b-movies and partly because of the attractive lead characters. Both Buffy and the spin-off series Angel are probably the most common TV series to be referenced on list, and also the series where spoilers are least welcome.</p>

<p><b>*Update*</b> - both shows are no longer produced so spoilers are probably ok now, unless our good friend and loyal member Herbert Wells is on channel at the time.</p>

    <a name="acme" /><h2><a href="#acme" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What are Acme::Buffy and Acme::Pony?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>Acme::Buffy and Pony are perl modules of dubious practical value which will reformat your code in a more london.pm friendly way. In this case Damian Conway and his Acme::Bleach module are to blame.</p>
    </div>

	<a name="pony" /><h2><a href="#pony" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What is it with the ponies?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>If people think you're acting stressed on IRC, then they may well offer you a pony to stroke, since stroking a pony makes it all better. For more extreme times, there may even be a 'pony drop' of many ponies.</p>
	</div>

        <a name="monkeys" /><h2><a href="#monkeys" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Who or what are the dancing monkeys?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>
			The dancing monkeys or, if we're being cultural, <i>les singe qui dansent</i>, are those London.pm members who 
                     	on any given subject will make a lot of noise, offer suggestions, make proclamations, fling faeces, indignantly post about people
			who they perceived have slighted them, the list, the IRC channel or Perl in general and, by and large, create more 
			noise than signal.
		</p>

		<p>
			Occasionally amusing but more often annoying no-one is entirely sure why they do this since it is widely known
			that such posturing is not big, clever or  hard.
		</p>

		<p>
			The monkeys who will dance for any given occasion is fairly predictable but we keep them around for the few
			times that they are actually amusing.

	<a name="jfdi" /><h2><a href="#jfdi" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What does JFDI mean?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>It's an acronym for Just F**king Do It - or, in other words, <i>"stop talking about it and just get on with it"</i></p>
		<p>Our good friend from Boston, obra, might have been the person to make it popular - he certainly printed the t-shirts</p>

	<a name="pimb" /><h2><a href="#pimb" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What were the Perl Is My Bitch t-shirts?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>When London.pm were organising YAPC::Europe 2000, the group produced a set of t-shirts with the YAPC logo. At the same time, <span class="person">Simon Wistow</span> was planning to produce a run of t-shirts with the slogan 'Perl is my Bitch'. When the news of this reached the list (and two others), there was a massive flame war over the misogyny and business-hostile nature that some people perceived in the slogan.</p>

		<p>As a result, the shirts weren't produced as part of the YAPC fundraising, but did get produced in a much more low-key unofficial manner later that year. Occasionally Simon threatens to do another run, but at the moment there are only fifty t-shirts in existence, none of which are for sale.</p>  
		
		<p><b>*Update*</b> at <a href="http://yapc.mongueurs.net/">YAPC::Europe 2003</a> Simon auctioned off one last t-shirt that he'd found and donated the money to YAS. The lucky winner was  Philippe 'BooK' Bruhat who paid an astounding 250 Euros for it.</p>

  <a name="dimsum" /><h2><a href="#dimsum" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What and where are dim sum?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
    <p>Dim sum is a facet of Chinese cuisine consisting of a hotpotch of little dishes which you pick and mix from to create a meal. London.pm has seemingly become fond of going to places like the New World in Chinatown to eat dim sum for lunch, and you'll see messages on IRC and the mailing list asking about meeting there sometimes.</p>

  </div>

	<a name="tvr" /><h2><a href="#tvr" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What is a TVR?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>TVR is a cocktail of tequila, vodka and Red Bull that is available at the Penderel's Oak and other places. Some of London.pm's most debauched meetings have been held under the influence of this substance.</p>
	</div>
	
	<a name="kitty" /><h2><a href="#kitty" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">What's the kitty?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>At social meetings, the first few people there should procure an empty, dry pint glass for keeping money in. People are requested to add a note (usually a tenner) to the kitty, and then when people go to the bar they just take the kitty. This saves the tedious nature of buying small rounds, and worrying if you get to the end of the night and feel you should have bought more people drinks.</p>
		<p>To further confuse you, one of our members has the nick name 'kitty'</p>

	<a name="leon" /><h2><a href="#leon" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Why do people remark about Leon and orange?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p><span class="person">Leon Brocard</span> seems to make wearing orange (and using it as a colour in web page design) his point in life; or at least, that's how some people perceive it.</p>
	</div>

	<a name="orange" /><h2><a href="#orange" onclick="checkTitle(); return 1;">Is that why the site is this hideous orange colour?<img src="/static/images/permalink.gif" border="0"></a>
    </h2><div class="item">
		<p>Yes. Leon and a cabal of supporters bought the 'official London.pm colour' at YAPC::Europe in 2002. Since there's not really anywhere for it to manifest itself other than this site, london.pm.org is now bright orange, with brown bits.</p>
