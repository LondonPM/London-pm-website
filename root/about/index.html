<h2>What is London.pm?</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    London Perl Mongers is a group of people who use <a
    href="glossary.html#perl">Perl</a> in their work or personal
    programming projects and like to meet and talk about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    London.pm has social and technical meetings, hack days, a mailing
    list, an IRC channel and fits into the larger <a
    href="glossary.html#perlmongers">Perl Mongers</a> organisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Curiously, London.pm members aren't confined to London or
    even the UK, but live all around the world.
  </p>
</div>
      
<h2>When do you meet?</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    London.pm social meetings are held on the first Thursday of
    the month. Without fail.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Hack days are held bi-monthly on Saturday afternoons at the
    London Hackspace, which is kind enough to let us use their
    facilities for no extra charge. A number of London PM members
    are also Hackspace members.
  </p>

  <p>
    Technical meetings are held whenever they are organised. They tend
    to be on Thursday evenings. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Additional <a href="faq.html#heretics">"heretics" social meetings</a> are held when the
    first day of a month is a Thursday.

<h2>General email list</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    You can <a href="https://groups.perlists.pm/sympa/info/london.pm">
    subscribe to the london.pm mailing list</a> or read the 
    <a href="https://groups.perlists.pm/sympa/arc/london.pm">archives online</a>.
  </p>

</div>
  
<h2>Announcement email list</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    London PM meetings and other events will be posted on the 
    <a href="https://groups.perlists.pm/sympa/info/london.pm-announce">announcement
    list</a>. The archives for this list are <a href="https://groups.perlists.pm/sympa/arc/london.pm-announce">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The general london.pm list is subscribed to this list, so you do not need
    to subscribe to both. It is low-traffic and moderated to try to ensure it is
    always On Topic.
  </p>
</div>
  
<h2>You mentioned an IRC channel.</h2><div class="item">
  <p>
    A lot of us use the IRC channel #london.pm on the perl.org network. 
    Connect to irc.perl.org, and /join #london.pm.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are a couple of bots on channel; there's a
    short <a href="irc.html">guide to the channel</a> so you know
    who's who.
  </p>
</div>


  <h2>What have London.pm achieved?</h2><div class="item">
    <p>
      London PM organised the first <a href="http://yapc.org/Europe/2000/">YAPC::Europe</a>
      conference and raised some of the initial funding for sponsoring <a
      href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/">Damian Conway</a> to work on Perl for a year
      via Yet Another Society. London PM members have spoken at all of the major Perl
      conferences, including TPC, YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe and the
      German Perl Workshop. and several of our members have authored
      <a href="/reviews/">books.</a>
      Once upon a time, London PM members <a href="camel.html">sponsored a camel</a> at
      the London Zoo.
    </p>

    <p>
      London.pm members have authored scores of CPAN modules, acted as release
      managers for Perl 5, and contributed patches and code for Perl 5 and
      Perl 6. They also volunteer their time to work on Perl's toolchain and testing 
      projects.
    </p>
