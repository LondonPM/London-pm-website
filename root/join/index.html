	<h2>Come To A Meeting</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		Socials are just that, people getting together in a pub to have a drink and
		a chat, pub meal optional. Social meetings start about 6:30pm and happen
		usually once a month, usually on a Thursday.

	<h2>Get On Our Mailing Lists</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		London Perl Mongers has two low-traffic mailing lists which are hosted by nice people at
		<a href="https://www.renater.fr">Renater</a> on open source Perl mailing list
		server software called <a href="https://www.sympa.org/">Sympa</a>. There is
		a general discussion list and an announcements list. The general list is subscribed
		to the announcements list so you don't need to be on both. 
		</p>
                <p>
		You need to use the email interface to subscribe because the web interface is 
		too much like hard work.<br/>
