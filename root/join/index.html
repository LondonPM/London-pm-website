	<h2>Come To A Meeting</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		We have three sorts of meetings, social, technical and hack days. The calendar
		on the home page of this website is the best source of information on dates,
		times and locations, along with the announcements email list described below.  
		</p>
		<p>
		Socials are just that, people getting together in a pub to have a drink and
		a chat, pub meal optional. Social meetings start about 6:30pm and happen at
		least once a month usually on a Thursday.
		</p>
		<p>
		The technical meetings are held somewhere with chairs and a projector 
		and people are invited to give talks on whatever they are working on. We
		have been experimenting with streaming talks via Periscope.tv and some have
		been uploaded to youtube. The videos are not guaranteed to be of particularly
		high quality but we're sort of working on it. More info on this to be added
		later when we're more organised - for now check the list or ask on IRC.
		</p>
                <p>
		Hack days are held approximately every other month on Saturday afternoons
		at the <a href="https://london.hackspace.org.uk/">London Hackspace</a>.
		LHS has a classroom area that we book for the duration, excellent broadband
		and an atmosphere fairly conducive to tinkering with software and other stuff. 
		Sometimes we have a theme, sometimes we don't. See this cheapo 
		<a href="http://london.pm.org:8080/quiki.cgi">wiki page</a> for a bit more information.

	<h2>Get On Our Mailing Lists</h2><div class="item">
		<p>
		London Perl Mongers has two low-traffic mailing lists which are hosted by nice people at
		<a href="https://www.renater.fr">Renater</a> on open source Perl mailing list
		server software called <a href="https://www.sympa.org/">Sympa</a>. There is
		a general discussion list and an announcements list. The general list is subscribed
		to the announcements list so you don't need to be on both. 
		</p>
                <p>
		You need to use the email interface to subscribe because the web interface is 
		too much like hard work.<br/>

	<h2>Join the IRC channel</h2><div class="item">
