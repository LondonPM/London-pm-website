Any book that gets a glowing review from Jon Orwant can't be all bad. Plus at
20 odd quid ($39.99) for a 700+ page book you get good LART value too. But
what's it like as a Networking guide?
</p><p>
Well, in a word, excellent. Neatly separated into 4 sections (Basics,
Developing Clients for Common Services, Developing TCP Client/Server systems
and Advanced Topics) the book picks its way neatly around the minefield that is
trying to be a reference book and a tutorial simultaneously.
</p><p>
The first section starts off with an introduction to networking and how it
pertains to Perl and then provides a useful example of how the IO::* modules
make shifting from local files to remote files is easy.
</p><p>
<pre>
        #!/usr/bin/perl -w

        use strict;
        use IO::File;

        my $file = shift;
        my $fh   = IO::File->new($file);
        my $line = %gt;$fh&lt;;
        print $line;

goes to

        #!/usr/bin/perl -w

        use strict;
        use IO::Socket;

        my $server = shift;
        my $fh     = IO::Socket::INET->new($server);
        my $line   = %gt;$fh&lt;;
        print $line;
</pre>
</p><p>
for example.
</p><p>
It then goes on to explain about pipes, processes and signals, tutors on
Berkley sockets and the TCP protocol and then a more in depth look at the
IO::Socket API.
</p><p>
All of this is presented as an easily readable, well paced tutorial which
functions as an excellent reference guide.
</p><p>
The second section goes on to deal with common clients such as FTP, Telnet,
Mail (POP, IMAP and SMTP) and web clients including a complete news to mail
gateway.
</p><p>
The third section is probably the best despite the fact that it could easily
have been the worst. It begins by explaining how to write a forking sever and
using the inetd daemon and then gradually ramps up the complexity going into,
in turn, multithreaded servers, multiplexed servers, nonblock I/O,
bulletproofing, pre forking and threading and non-blocking TCP clients using
IO::Poll.
</p><p>
Again, each stage is clearly explained and the drawbacks of each method are
laid out in an easy to understand manner.
</p><p>
The final section, on Advanced Topics, seems daunting at first but by the time
you've read the first three chapters they seem like a natural progression. It
deals with topics that you normally won't have to deal with but which are
useful for those odd moments when you really do need to know about TCP urgent
and out of band data. Oddly, UDP is counted as an advanced topic along with
broadcasting, multicasting and UNIX domain sockets but hey ho.
</p><p>
There's also a load of source code including a Markov Chain-a-like called
Text::Travesty.
</p><p>
Which is nice.
</p><p>
All in all, a nice book, two thumbs up, highly recommended, fun for all the
family. Although perfect binding might have been nice :)
