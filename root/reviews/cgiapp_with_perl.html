There are a very large number of Perl CGI books in the shops. Unfortunately
the number of good Perl CGI books is far smaller. I'm happy to report that
this book is one of them.
</p><p>
The problem, of course, with most Perl CGI books is that they are written by
people who just don't know very much Perl. That's certainly not the case
here. Both Kevin and Brent are well-respected members of the Perl community
and they know what they are talking about when it comes to writing CGI
programs in Perl.
</p><p>
Another common mistake in Perl CGI books is that the authors try to take
people who know a bit of HTML and teach them programming, Perl and CGI all
at the same time. The authors of this book realise that this approach is
likely to lead to, at best, patchy understanding of any of these concepts so
they aim there book at people who are already programmers and who have some
knowledge of Perl. This means that they can concentrate of teaching the
parts of Perl that are useful when writing CGI programs.
</p><p>
One corner that is often cut when discussing CGI programming is security.
This is a very dangerous approach to take as a badly written CGI program can
leave your web server open to attack from anyone on the Internet. That's not
a mistake that is made here as the authors introduce security in chapter 2.
Add to that the fact that the code examples all use -w, use strict and
CGI.pm and the book is already head and shoulders above most of its
competition.
</p><p>
Early chapters look at common CGI requirements such as file uploads and
cookies. Each chapter is full of well written (and well-explained) sample
code. The example of an access counter in chapter 6 even locks the file
containing the current count - this is possibly a first in a Perl CGI book!
</p><p>
By the middle of the book we have already moved beyond simple CGI
programming and are looking at mod_perl. This chapter covers both the
`faux-CGI'' Apache::Registry module and also writing complete mod_perl
handlers.
</p><p>
In the second half of the book we start to look at some bigger examples. The
authors present a web-based email system and even a shopping cart. In order
to fit these examples into their respective chapters a couple of corners
have been cut, but there's enough information there to enable anyone to
write the complete systems.
</p><p>
Chapter 13 introduces the HTML::Mason module as a way to separate content
from presentation. It's obvious that the author's are big fans of this
module and this leads to my only real criticism of the book. At no point do
they mention the fact that the same benefits can be gained from using any of
half a dozen templating systems found on the CPAN. I would have been a lot
happier if they had mentioned things like Text::Template, HTML::Template and
the Template Toolkit before picking HTML::Mason as the system for their
example.
</p><p>
There are then two more long chapters with examples of a document management
system and image manipulation software. Once more the code in these examples
would serve as a greating starting point for anyone wanting to implement
something along these lines. The last chapter looks at XML and, in
particular, the use of RSS files to provide data feeds to other web sites.
</p><p>
All in all this is a very useful book for someone wanting to write web-based
applications using Perl. It's packed full of good advice and code that
follows all of the best practices for writing CGI programs in Perl. This
book won't teach you Perl, but if you've read Learning Perl or Elements of
Programming with Perl then you'll find this book easy enough to follow.
