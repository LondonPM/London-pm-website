<div class="item">
  <p>Authors: Stas Bekman &amp; Eric Cholet</p>
  <p>ISBN: <div class="isbn">0-596-00227-0</div></p>
  <p>Publisher: O'Reilly (2003)</p>
  <p>Reviewed by: Dave Cross</p>

    <p>At almost 900 pages, this is certainly the <i>biggest</i> book on
<span class="code">mod_perl</span> that has been published so far. In my opinion it's
also one of the most useful.</p>
    <p>Stas Bekman and Eric Cholet are two of the best-known and 
(probably more importantly) most respected names in the <span class="code">mod_perl</span>
community so you can be sure the the information you get in this book is
going to be top quality.</p>
    <p>Part 1 of the book is about <span class="code">mod_perl</span> administration. It
starts with an overview of what <span class="code">mod_perl</span> is and how it relates
to CGI and the Apache web server before going into a chapter which gives
a quickstart guide to installing and using <span class="code">mod_perl</span> on some
of the most common platforms. Chapter three then goes back over the
installation process in far more detail. Chapter four explains how to 
configure <span class="code">mod_perl</span> in various ways and chapter five cover
monitoring, upgrading and maintaining your <span class="code">mod_perl</span> enabled
web server. Chapter 6 is full of advice about how to write Perl code
that takes advantage of <span class="code">mod_perl</span>'s features.</p>
    <p>Part 2 is all about <span class="code">mod_perl</span> performance and contains
chapters about benchmarking and tuning your server. I found chapter twelve 
to be particularly useful as it discusses a number of useful strategies
for splitting server load between a <span class="code">mod_perl</span> server for
dynmaic content and a "plain" (non-<span class="code">mod_perl</span>) server for
static content. Other chapters in this section cover other strategies
for improving performance by tuning Apache's configuration, changing
your Apache and <span class="code">mod_perl</span> build options and being cleverer
about the HTTP headers that you return.</p>
    <p>Most dynamic web sites have a database involved somewhere so part 3
covers using databases with <span class="code">mod_perl</span>. Part 4 is all about
debugging and troubleshooting your <span class="code">mod_perl</span> server.
Finally, part 5 looks at what has changed with the release of the
forthcoming <span class="code">mod_perl 2.0</span>.</p>
    <p>And this isn't just theoretical stuff. The two authors have been
involved in developing <span class="code">mod_perl</span> for a long time but they
are also <span class="code">mod_perl</span> users. You can just tell from the way
they write that the problems they discuss are problems they have dealt
with. This is the voice (or, rather, voices) of experience.</p>
    <p>A lot of the text in the book is based on the <span class="code">mod_perl</span>
guide which has been available on the web for some time, but all of the
content has been revisited, updated and expanded. This book is not really
in competition with books like <i>The <span class="code">mod_perl</span> Developers
Cookbook</i> or the older <i>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C</i>
as those books largely concentrate on how to write code for 
<span class="code">mod_perl</span> whereas the emphasis in this book is on configuring
and administering a <span class="code">mod_perl</span> server.</p>
    <p>And if you are the administrator of a <span class="code">mod_perl</span>
server then you should really consider adding this book to your
library.</p>
