<p>Forensic Discovery is a small book that packs a big punch. In just over
200 pages it presents more information than books three times its size (and
weight).</p>

<p>The book is divided in to three main sections. The first,
"Basic Concepts", explains two of the books core ideas, the order of
volatility, how it influences the gathering of evidence, and the
importance of time based information. It also introduces a number of
less obvious information sources, such as the Ext2/3 file system journal
and in memory DNS caches before providing a primer on MACtimes. Chapter
two ends with an example intrusion, how the time based information
revealed the attackers actions and a second previously undetected
intrusion.</p>

The second part, which makes up the bulk of the book, dives in to file
systems, subverting kernels and (the slightly out of place but still
interesting) analysing malware. These chapters cover a lot of ground in a
rapid, but understandable way. Due to the size of the book all padding
seems to have been stripped out, leaving nothing but the highlights. And
when the authors are Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema there are a lot of
highlights.

The final section is two, technically dense, chapters long. The first
looks at how long deleted files persist on disk, the information they
leave behind, presents some tools that can help retrieve them and
shows some example retrieval numbers taken from experiments using
Solaris, FreeBSD and Linux. The closing chapter focuses on memory. It
explains how swap and memory pages relate to forensic discovery, how files
reside in memory and how to extract chunks of them once the file has been
deleted.

<p>While the principles presented are widely applicable, nearly all of the
technical examples are Unix focused. The concepts are clearly presented
and remarkably accessible but the examples themselves require strong
familiarity with Unix commands, file-systems, networking and processes.
It's also worth noting that the book is full of little tips and tricks -
examples are detecting filesystems mounted over existing directories,
extracting chunks of files using lazarus.</p>

<p>Score: 8/10. Essential reading for anyone interested in digital
forensics, a greater understanding of Unix systems or just some very cool
technical tricks.</p>
