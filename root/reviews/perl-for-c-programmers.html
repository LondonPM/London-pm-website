<p>This is a book aimed at C programmers who want to learn perl. It doesn't
teach you to program, as it is aimed squarely at people who already know C
(or a related language such as C++). Similarly it doesn't waste time teaching
you the parts of perl that are the same as C; it notes that they are the same,
and moves on to where perl differs. To paraphrase the Ronseal advert, it's a
tutorial that "does exactly what it says on the tin".</p>

<p>The classic first example in any programming tutorial is printing "hello
world". So it's notable that this book doesn't start with "hello world". In
fact the first chapter only has one perl script, midway through. Instead the
first chapter describes where to find documentation on perl, how to find and
download modules from CPAN (4th paragraph!), and how to use perl debuggers,
both the builtin debugger and Tk's debugger. The prominence given to
debuggers may seem strange to perl programmers, who are more used to
inserting a <span class="code">print</span> statement, but C, with its potentially
lengthy compile and link cycle, means that it's often far more efficient to
use a debugger, hence it is explaining perl in terms important to a
programmer with a C background.</p>
<p>The author explains early on that he isn't going to regurgitate the perl
documentation through the book; paper versions are "expensive, out-of-date,
and more difficult to access than the stuff that comes with Perl." I
wholeheartedly agree. Instead the end of each chapter has a "resources"
section which gives the relevant perl man pages (expressed as the
<span class="code">perldoc</span> commands needed to view them), relevant URLs, and the
names of all modules used in that chapter. This book teaches good habits:
it emphasises where to find the documentation you need, it encourages code
re-use (via CPAN), all the example programs are fully documented in POD,
every <span class="code">open</span> is checked, with a helpful <span class="code">die</span> on failure,
all the programs <span class="code">use strict;</span> and <span class="code">use warnings</span>, and
all the CGI examples use taint mode too. The text is well written in style that
is easy to read, and the light dusting of humour stops it becoming dry.</p>

<p>The second and third chapters explain the basics of perl; the parts that
are similar to C, such as control logic, scalars and arrays. The book clearly
explains the potential traps and pitfalls that are new with perl, such as
the C trap of <span class="code">=</span> vs <span class="code">==</span> gaining a new twist with
<span class="code">==</span> vs <span class="code">eq</span>. It explains the meaning of truth, and
how perl's rules mean that <span class="code">"00"</span> is true, which can come as a
surprise. The book keeps to a minimum forward references to syntax covered in
later chapters, but is not afraid to use them where unavoidable.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 explains regular expressions, and this is the first
disappointment. Regular expressions are the greatest strength of perl, and
will be new to most C programmers. Hence they would benefit greatly from a
clear introduction to regular expressions. Sadly this chapter does not
provide one. The author states that commenting regular expressions helps
organise your thoughts, helps make sure all the parts do what they should,
and helps subsequent maintainers. He starts using a commenting syntax
like this
<pre>
#    ++--------- literal dot
#    ||++------- literal dollar
#    ||||++----- word character
#    ||||||+---- repeated 1 or more times
if (/\.\$\w+/)
</pre>
and only later moves on to the <span class="code">//x</span> flag. For the example that he
comments both ways, he observes
<blockquote>Now are these 29 lines of comment regular expression easier to read
than the line regular expression with its 24 lines
of comments? Not that much really. It seems that no matter how you arrange
a mess, it still looks like a mess.</blockquote> It's his book; he's entitled to
his
opinion, but I fear it will put potential perl programmers off one of the
most important parts of perl, and consequentially they won't benefit from
the full power of the language. Also, he missed the important objective
point that his line commenting style will make maintenance pig as soon as
any part of the regexp is edited to a different width - so in his example
keeping the comment up to date could require 24 lines of editing for a 1
character tweak to the regexp.</p>
<p>His regexp examples get far too complex far too quickly. Barely has he
introduced regexps, when he's starting to write regexps to match balanced
quoted strings, including using negative look behind assertions. This is not
a good idea - quoted strings, particularly with escaped quotes inside, are
complex beasts, and the fearsome regexps they need are not good teaching
aids. He also does something I've never seen any regexp tutorial do; he uses
<span class="code">re 'debug'</span> to try to explain how regexps work. The
<i>perldebug</i> documentation says that the debugging output is aimed at
debugging perl's regexp engine, not users' regexps. I think he's
misunderstood its purpose, which is unfortunate as he spends a full third of
his regexps chapter on it.</p>

<p>He doesn't provide any memorable overview of how regexps work. He doesn't
explain that alphanumerics match as is, and only become meta-characters when
preceded by backslash, whereas punctuation characters start off as
meta-characters but become literals when escaped by a backslash. He doesn't
explain that upper and lower case alphabetics are opposites, such as
<span class="code">\s</span> matching whitespace, <span class="code">\S</span> matching
non-whitespace.  You won't learn regexps from this chapter - you'll learn to
be scared of them.</p>

<p>The next chapters build logically, giving an overview of perl's new
syntax (<i>ie</i> new to a C programmer), hashes, complex data structures,
subroutines, modules, object orientation, advanced I/O and finally POD. This
takes roughly until the middle of the book. The syntax introduction is
logical, although there are several cases where subtly different new syntax
is slipped in without any comment, such as <span class="code">x</span> on a list instead
of a scalar (page 61), adding a second argument to <span class="code">bless</span> (page
157), and <span class="code">&lt;&gt;</span> in list context (page 118). I would have
hoped that the technical reviewers would have spotted these. The "new"
syntax chapter attempts to cover all syntax variations you might meet (while
wisely recommending not to use them) but doesn't mention hash slices, which
are likely to confuse the unsuspecting. Also, there is a subtle but crucial
error in the description of <span class="code">foreach</span> - the books wrongly says
that the loop variable is <em>assigned</em> - I pity the programmer who as a
result spends considerable time tracing down a bug because he didn't realise
that actually it is <em>aliased</em>.</p>
<p>The second half of the book puts it all together, with complete examples
of perl programs. This half is somewhat disappointing. The programs tend to
be presented complete rather than broken down by re-usuable functionality.
There is no "here is how it would be done in C; here it is in perl" to show
where perl has the advantage over C, and how to translate your thought
process from C to perl. There are comments on how the programs work, but
they are not overly detailed because most of the examples are not that
complex in function. The author is very thorough in his POD documentation,
and 100% consistent in his use of <span class="code">strict</span> and
<span class="code">warnings</span>, which is good. He also includes the complete listing
of every program, and I make the ratio <span class="code">description:code listing</span>
about <span class="code">1:2</span>. In addition, about 50% of the description section is
spent citing the code to explain how each section works. For contrast, I
estimate that the ratio in the <i>Perl Cookbook</i> of textual description
to code is <span class="code">2:1</span>. The examples can all be downloaded from the <a
href="http://www.newriders.com/">New Riders website</a> (not the <a
href="http://www.oualline.com/perl">URL given on the book cover</a>, which
is currently a 404). Given that all the important code is stated in the
descriptions, the book would be leaner and more efficient without the full
listings, but it would then have a thinner spine.</p>
<p>Some related example programs seem to suffer from insufficient extraction of
common functionality to modules, but most examples are careful to put their
re-usable code in modules. Unfortunately, you can see that the author is
from a Unix/C background (laid back lowercase, rather than SHOUTY DOS or VMS
UPPERCASE) because he names all his example modules completely in
lowercase. This contradicts the most important perl module naming guideline
- all lowercase is pragma space, which is an unfortunate habit to get into
if you ever want to contribute to CPAN. Also all the modules use
<span class="code">@EXPORT</span> exclusively, instead of the more polite
<span class="code">@EXPORT_OK</span>, and all sit in top level namespaces.</p>

<p>The CGI examples all use tainting, are careful to HTML encode all input
they are sending out, and use modules whenever possible rather than hand rolled
code. There is a note that input parameters can be array references
rather than simple scalars if they are specified multiple times. There is a
good section on basic security, so if this is your first introduction to CGI
programming you'll have to <b>un</b>learn things to make basic security
mistakes.  It suggests crafty ways of running a CGI script from the webserver
for both the command line or Tk debuggers, which I'd never considered, but
might turn out to be productivity boons. However the examples all use
heredocs of HTML code, without even a mention of templating systems. For
simple examples this is perfectly adequate, but if you're using this book as
a first step into web programming, it doesn't teach you that it is good
design to split content and presentation logic - you're likely to discover
this only after you've build a legacy maintenance nightmare.</p>
<p>The perl code taught is not particularly idiomatic. For example, the
author likes writing<pre>
  while (1) {
    my $line = &lt;&lt;IN_FILE&gt;&gt;

    if (not defined($line)) {
      last;
    }
</pre>
instead of the terser and clearer:
<pre>
  while (defined(my $line = &lt;&lt;IN_FILE&gt;&gt;)) {
</pre>
There is also needless copying, that will start impact on efficiency. There
are several examples of the form
<pre>
    while (...) {
        <b>my</b> @data = ...;
        ...
        $accumulator{$key} = <b>[</b>@data<b>]</b>;
    }
</pre>
for both arrays and hashes. Copying the array using the <span class="code">[ ]</span>
anonymous array reference constructors <b>isn't</b> necessary because the
<span class="code">my</span> will create a new array for <span class="code">@data</span> on each
iteration, so it's more efficient to replace <span class="code">[@data]</span> with
<span class="code">\@data</span>.</p>
<p>There is no mention of autovivification of references, which is one of
the major programmer advantages of perl over C. It's not clear whether the
author is even aware of it, as his code is always careful to initialise
his array references to <span class="code">[]</span> before assigning to them. The
author also likes using <span class="code">not defined ($hash{$key})</span> for an
entry that will either exist as a reference or not exist - simply using
inverting the order of the condition and writing <span class="code">$hash{$key}</span>
simplifies things greatly. Individually these are minor points, but together
they mean that this book alone will never teach you to be a fluent perl
programmer.</p>

<p>In summary, this book will do what it claims - teach perl to C programmers.
If you understand C or a C like language, you can probably read this book
through in under a day, and it will give you a grounding in almost all the
topics you'd need to be a competent and effective perl programmer. Just skip
the chapter on regular expressions, and use a good regular expression tutorial
instead. This book does one thing, and does it well. However I suspect that
this means that you will read it about twice, by which time it will give you
the confidence and ability to find everything you need answered online, from
which point it will remain on your bookshelf.</p>
