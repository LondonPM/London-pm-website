<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
An interesting book that presents a useful approach, some good idea's and
many pithy quotes but not a classic.</p>
<p>Testing is one of the most overlooked phases of the development cycle. From
the worst case scenario of not being done to the more common case of all
the testing being done at the tail end of a project, when time is most
precious and least available, it is more often a rushed afterthought than
a real part of the process. Kent Beck's new book sets out to change this by
encouraging the writing of tests before code.</p>

<p>The principles behind this approach are simple in essence. First you write
the test code, code that does not even have to compile. Then you add the
minimum amount of code to the real project that enables the test to
run successfully. Once the test runs you refactor and remove duplication
tidying your code and removing any 'sins' you committed to get the test
running as quickly as possible. Beck refers to this as the Test Driven
Development (TDD) mantra; Red/Green/Refactor.</p>

<p>The book is broken up into three parts consisting of 32 short chapters and
two appendixes.

<ul>
<li>Part 1: "The Money Example"</li>
<li>Part 2: "The xUnit Example"</li>
<li>Part 3: "Patterns for Test-Driven Development"</li>
<li>Append 1: Influence Diagrams</li>
<li>Append 2: Fibonacci</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Part one eases you into the ideas behind TDD by applying it to a set of
classes that will be used for multi-currency arithmetic. While the examples
are well explained and illustrate the basic benefits I do feel that even in
this early section readers will bring more away from the book if they have
read Fowler's excellent book on Refactoring. TDD assumes some knowledge of
both the concept of design patterns and the terminology of refactoring.
The code examples in this section are easy to follow and written in Java.</p>

<p>The second part of the book is another case study on a project using TDD,
this time the emphasis is on building a basic xUnit testing framework
in Python. The examples here illustrate some of the more advanced design
decisions behind a TDD project while also picking up the pace by dropping
the tiny steps approach used in the first chapter.</p>

<p>The third part of the book shows the design patterns that were used in the
previous sections. These chapters are more reference like in style and will
be the part of the book you gain the most reuse from once you have read the
through the whole book.</p>

<p>Appendix I briefly covers Influence Diagrams, a simple way of displaying a
systems positive and negative feedback and connections. This is followed by
a very short case study of implementing a test driven Fibonacci. This is a
very terse example that condenses and rehashes part one and helps to
reinforce what you have learned. If you like to see the code then this may
be the section of the book that makes the bulb come on.</p>

<p>This is not a long book and is written in a chatty style that makes it an
easy read. The examples are short, clear and to the point, although i
did get the impression that the author didn't really like Java but was a
Smalltalk fan. This doesn't detract from the book but it does make you look
twice at the few Smalltalk code samples if you come from a main stream
language. The Smalltalk examples could have been implemented in something
more common such as Java or C++ and been just as effective but more
accessible to the mass market.</p>

<p>In order to get the most out of the book the author recommends working
along through the examples on a computer, i agree with this, i retain
more if I'm active rather than passive and this book is written in a style
that suits and encourages this approach. Something that annoyed
me however was the lack of concrete, full code. Although the examples are
complete and show the changes being made and discussed you are expected to
know enough about the language being used to put the classes together and
run them on your own.</p>

<p>A good example of this is the Java code, it is never given as an actual
class but rather presented as a selection of methods. It would have been
nice to have a boxout with the code as it looked at that stage every few
chapters. The same can be said of the test suite code. This is not a show
stopper but coupled with the complete lack of JUnit coverage (JUnit is used
in some screen-shots and would have made it simpler to follow along) and
the use of two main languages it raises the entry bar, something that could
have been avoided by the inclusion of a small third appendix and a small
number of more detailed code samples.</p>
