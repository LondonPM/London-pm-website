    <p>For those that live in the land of the magic LAMP the name Mike Gunderloy
       might not ring any bells. For those in the Windows world
       it's more familiar, the author of too many books to count,
       articles in Microsoft Certified Professional magazine (among a
       fair few others!), his own 
       <a href="http://www.larkware.com/">Larkware</a> site and now Coder
       To Developer.
    </p>

    <p>The book draws upon the author's years of experience to cover the
       areas that coders new to the real world of development will find
       themselves unprepared for, especially if they have come from a
       hobbyist or purely academic background. It covers areas that are
       not typically taught and that you are expected to pick up as you
       go along. These include revision control, comprehensive
       application logging and managing the build process. The full
       chapter list is given below:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Chapter 1: Planning Your Project</li>
      <li>Chapter 2: Organizing Your Project</li>
      <li>Chapter 3: Using Source Code Control Effectively</li>
      <li>Chapter 4: Coding Defensively</li>
      <li>Chapter 5: Preventing Bugs with Unit Testing</li>
      <li>Chapter 6: Pumping Up the IDE</li>
      <li>Chapter 7: Digging Into Source Code</li>
      <li>Chapter 8: Generating Code</li>
      <li>Chapter 9: Tracking and Squashing Bugs</li>
      <li>Chapter 10: Logging Application Activity</li>
      <li>Chapter 11: Working with Small Teams</li>
      <li>Chapter 12: Creating Documentation</li>
      <li>Chapter 13: Mastering the Build Process</li>
      <li>Chapter 14: Protecting Your Intellectual Property</li>
      <li>Chapter 15: Delivering the Application</li>
    </ul>

    <p> 
      It is worth pointing out the ideal target audience. While the book
      assumes you have the ability to read modern object oriented code
      (basic exposure to Java or C# should suffice), it doesn't assume
      much beyond that. The code snippets and examples are clearly
      explained where needed and are pretty much self documenting. The
      other noteworthy aspect of the book is its focus on using
      Microsoft platforms, and .NET in particular, for both code
      examples and when pointing out the tools available. Most of the
      book is accessible and relevant to anyone developing in any
      language, on any platform. However a number of chapters, Chapter 6
      "Pumping Up the IDE" being the most extreme example, are going to
      be a lot more use to .NET coders in particular.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The chapters follow the development of a custom built application,
      Download Tracker, from the design and requirements phase through to
      packaging ready for deployment. Chunks of its code are used to help
      make the examples more concrete. While the chapter ordering has been
      chosen to mirror the life-cycle of a real project as closely as a
      book allows, each one is mostly self contained and can be dipped 
      into without the reader feeling lost.
    </p>

    <p>
       Some of the book's highlights include the three levels of source
       control enlightenment explained in chapter 3, the bullet point
       summary at the end of each chapter and the coverage given to the
       available tools when a topic is being discussed. While the
       introduction and brief comparison of the available options are
       useful, these parts of the book are the most susceptible to rapid
       aging. While the principles and practices covered are likely to
       stand the test of time, the tools coverage will rapidly become out
       of date and require a second edition; something I'm looking
       forward to already.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nicest thing I can say about this book is that it is "The
      Pragmatic Programmer" for the .NET generation, which is no small
      accolade. If you've been doing professional development for less
      than a couple of years then it's worth an 8/10 and a couple of
      days of your time. For more experienced people (especially those
      moving to .NET from another environment), it is still worth
      looking through; while it might not be as career-changing you will
      probably still find some of the chapters give you a new take on
      your day-to-day work. For those readers its more 6-8/10 with the
      score dependent on how .NET focused and experienced you are.
