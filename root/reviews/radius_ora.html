<p>RADIUS (the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) isn't getting any
younger or popular, it's a specialised technology that very few people
seem to discuss and even fewer write books about. Unfortunately the ones
we do have, such as this, don't exactly encourage it's adoption.</p>

<p>The book starts with a solid overview of the AAA process/framework, AAA
in this context being Authentication, Authorisation and Access Control.
This is followed by a look at the typical client authentication
processes (in regards to systems layout and topology) and then finishes
with a brief, and very high level, overview of RADIUS.</p>

<p>Chapter two introduces some of the more technical details and covers the
basic packet structure, the packet types that comprise the
authentication and authorisation phases of each transaction and the two
main methods of authentication, PAP and CHAP. This is where I began to
struggle with the book, after a concise start in the first chapter I
felt I was being introduced to too much dry detail before I had a
conceptual grasp or relevant overview.</p>

<p>While I understand the need for the reader to possess certain
knowledge before advancing into the book, the facts seemed too dry and
too early to encourage anyone but the most determined first time reader.
If the reader was already familiar with the RADIUS protocol and
applications, then this section would make a better reference guide than
the RFC, although this is faint praise as it leaves the chapter in no-
mans land; too dry for casual reading and not the definitive answer.</p>

<p>Then we get to the chapter that made me stop reading the book on my
first and second attempt. Chapter 3 is an alphabetised listing of 63
RADIUS attributes taken from the RFC, but with slightly expanded
explanations. It's also a chapter that you'll skip, skim-read or it will
cause you to stop reading the book due to the sheer dry and frankly dull
explanations.</p>

<p>So you've persevered, skim-read when no one was looking and made it to
chapter 4! What delights await you? Well a short explanation of how
RADIUS accounting works and yes, more attribute lifted from the RFC.
This marks the end of what I'd consider the first part of the book (the
dry as heck theory section).</p>

<p>Moving on from here we have two hands-on chapters that introduce
FreeRADIUS, or at least they introduce an old version of the software.
It's worth noting that the book was released in October 2002 (and so was
probably written early in 2002) and my reading and review were both done
in 2004 so the aging of the software is an inescapable issue. These
chapters details configuration files that are no longer used and covers
config directives that are no longer valid or make any sense. Not
something that makes it easy to follow the text.</p>

<p>For the sake of full disclosure I'll confess I gave up half way
through chapter 5 (Getting Started With FreeRADIUS), I wasn't getting
anywhere trying to mentally map the configs in the book to those on screen
so I just skipped this and the following chapter, Advanced FreeRADIUS, with
the assumption I can learn enough about the server from current articles
and the man pages.</p>

<p>The tragic thing is that the third part of the book, chapters 7 through
to 10, is actually quite interesting, finally the author starts to
discuss how RADIUS fits into the bigger picture; it's just a shame so
few people will get this far. Topics include the current security
problems in the protocol, what's being planned for future releases
(including a short mention of a potential RADIUS replacement) and details two
sample, RADIUScentric, infrastructures.</p>

<p>With the benefit of hindsight (and this of course is going to be highly
subjective) I think the layout of the book is wrong, when you start
reading the early chapters no real hook is given. You are thrown
into low level details that are of very little use to beginners (I know
nothing of RADIUS) too soon. Instead I think the later chapters, the where,
why and how should be pulled forward and "dumb downed" to require less
knowledge of how RADIUS works. These would then provide a hook to
interest people and show them the more pragmatic and useful aspects of
the technology. After they know it can be useful illustrate how to set
up a simple server and then, in the third part, show how the underlying
principles work.</p>

<p>The short summary? If you have no previous knowledge of RADIUS then the
first and last four chapters are worth a read. If you do understand the
basics then save your money and read the man pages and RFCs (when actually
needed) instead. Score: 3/10</p>
